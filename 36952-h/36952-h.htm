7</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The following Addresses and Papers on various subjects have
been selected from many others contributed by the Author, as
thought to be possibly of sufficient interest in their respective
spheres to justify their reproduction in a collected form.&nbsp;
They are very diverse in their character, and embrace a great
variety of topics.</p>
<p>It has been well said that all men are delighted to look back;
and the Author, whilst thus recalling past work, can only express
the hope that some of these Papers may have contributed, however
infinitesimally, each in their own way and at their respective
times, to help forward the appreciation of the then present, or
the progress of the world&rsquo;s welfare or knowledge in the
future.</p>

PROPOSED PROVISION OF RECREATION GROUNDS FOR NORWICH.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Condensed Report of Speech in Norwich Town
Council, 1880, reprinted from the <i>Norwich Mercury</i> of
October 23rd, 1880:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dr. Eade, pursuant to notice, rose to call attention to the
question of recreation or playgrounds for the children of
Norwich.</p>
<p>He reminded the Council that four or five years ago, after
some considerable talk with leading citizens, he ventured in the
public Press to call attention to the deficiency which existed in
Norwich in respect of recreation or playgrounds, and also of
public baths.&nbsp; Ever since that time the question had, more
or less, started up at intervals, while certain steps had been
taken, which, in the course of time, would probably result in
something being achieved.&nbsp; But, as time went on, the city
was growing rapidly, open spaces were built upon, and he and
those who were anxious to see something done were passing
away.&nbsp; He had, therefore, taken upon himself once again to
call attention to the subject, and to ask the Council to take
action upon it.</p>
<p>After remarking upon the great importance now generally
attached to questions affecting the public health, sanitation, or
preventive medicine&mdash;for these were synonymous
terms&mdash;and the intimate connection <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>now
everywhere recognised between the general welfare of the
population of our great cities, and the absence of disease, with
the consequent reduction in the death-rate, Dr. Eade said that it
was entirely from the point of view of the public health that he
wished to call attention to this subject.&nbsp; The physical
growth, the physical well-being, and the physical development of
the population formed a large branch of this subject; and he was
afraid that, with regard to this, Norwich could not be said to be
in the forefront of progress.&nbsp; Even since he first mooted
the question many of the open spaces which he then believed
available for the purpose had been built over or otherwise dealt
with.</p>
<p>Norwich, once a city of gardens, was rapidly becoming a
cramped and over-crowded city&mdash;at least, in its older
portions; and in the new portions no provision was made for the
physical welfare of the population, and no opportunities were
given for the physical development of the children.&nbsp; Not in
a single instance had a good wide roadway been opened up in the
new districts; on the contrary, he was sorry to see in one or two
of the most populous districts roads which ought to be great,
wide thoroughfares, nothing better than narrow lanes.&nbsp; One
most remarkable instance was Unthank&rsquo;s Road, which was
being built up at the lower part where it was extremely narrow,
so that instead of being made a great artery for the traffic of
the city, it was converted into a mere lane, and it ought to be
called Unthank&rsquo;s Lane&mdash;not dignified by the name of
road.</p>
<p>No doubt before many years were over the city would have to
incur a large expenditure in widening that and other roads.&nbsp;
How short-sighted, then, was the policy of allowing such
encroachments to go on!</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>To show
what bearing these points had on public opinion long ago, Dr.
Eade pointed out that even in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time the
question was raised, as was seen in &ldquo;Julius
C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark Antony, in his speech to the
citizens, first asks&mdash;&ldquo;Wherein did C&aelig;sar thus
deserve your love?&rdquo; and then the reply comes (by his Will)
&ldquo;To every Roman citizen he gives seventy-five
drachmas;&rdquo; and afterwards&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Moreover, he hath left you all his
walks,<br />
His private arbours, and new planted orchards<br />
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you<br />
And to your heirs for ever; common pleasures,<br />
To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Eade proceeded to say he wished there were Julius
C&aelig;sars at the present time desirous of making wills for the
benefit of Norwich.&nbsp; He then quoted the opinions of Lord
Shaftesbury and the <i>Lancet</i> as to places of public
recreation and their influence upon the physical and moral
welfare of the population, and added, that he fully agreed with
the writer in the <i>Daily Press</i>, signing himself &ldquo;C.
I. T.,&rdquo; when he wrote&mdash;&ldquo;The city expects the
authorities to guard the health and lives of the humbler
population at all costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other towns had done and were doing that which he wanted them
to do in Norwich.&nbsp; Towns as large as Birmingham and as small
as Falmouth, had provided public parks, and many had more than
one.&nbsp; Birmingham had seven parks and recreation grounds,
Sheffield four, and Bradford three, while the latter town had
lately spent &pound;150,000 in carrying out what he was now
advocating.&nbsp; Norwich had a population of 90,000, and was
rapidly increasing and spreading on almost all sides&mdash;open
spaces being constantly taken up for building purposes.&nbsp;
Though <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>they had playgrounds attached to School Board schools,
he was sorry to find they were not available to the juvenile
population&mdash;that they were only open to the children
attending the schools during school hours, or a few minutes
before and after school.</p>
<p>Norwich stood the very lowest on the list of the towns of
England with regard to this question of recreation grounds.&nbsp;
They had waited and waited until the difficulty of providing such
places had greatly increased, while if they waited longer these
difficulties would become almost insuperable.&nbsp; When he first
started in this matter he could have found, or had the offer of,
several open places, but those were now built over.&nbsp; He, at
that time, took a great deal of trouble in the matter, but soon
found that notwithstanding the support given him by several
prominent citizens, it was far too large a matter for a single
individual to carry through; but now he had the honour of a seat
in the Council he claimed their attention, and, if possible,
their powerful sympathy and support.&nbsp; They might ask where
was the demand for recreation grounds.&nbsp; He asked those who
had children to bring up whether they would allow them to play in
narrow streets and crowded courts breathing impure air?&nbsp;
What was the reason of there being so many puny, delicate, and
small children?&nbsp; He ventured to say this was almost entirely
due to the unwholesome surroundings in which they were brought
up.&nbsp; He mentioned that in Glasgow recently, one medical man
lecturing in that city said that in one year he had treated 330
cases of children with deformed bones&mdash;bent legs, bent
thighs, knock-knees, etc.&mdash;which deformities were entirely
due to the want of proper development and to their unwholesome
surroundings.&nbsp; Much superior in many respects as Norwich was
to Glasgow, he ventured <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to say that the same condition of
things existed here.&nbsp; But the demand for places of
recreation was, he contended, proved by the fact that whenever a
plot of ground was cut up for building purposes, children crowded
there from all parts of the city to play, and this they continue
to do until driven away by the advance of bricks and
mortar.&nbsp; Then, too, Chapel Field, when it was open, was
often taken advantage of by 500 and 600 children and others, who
went there for play and enjoyment.</p>
<p>After making other observations as to the need of such places,
Dr. Eade said there were two ways in which the want might be
supplied.&nbsp; Playgrounds could not be taken close to every
door; but in every new district care should be taken to secure
the setting apart of a certain amount of space for the
children.&nbsp; One plan he would suggest was that at various
points in the city a field should be purchased and thrown open to
the children; and another plan was to purchase or hire a large
space which might be converted into a people&rsquo;s park, with a
small portion set apart for the use of children.</p>
<p>It might be said that such places would really be used by the
rough portion of the population; but he contended that it was for
just this portion of the population they were most
required.&nbsp; Let the rough children be brought up to know the
worth of fresh air, what it is to have healthy frames, so that in
after life they may not be poor and puny and miserable.&nbsp; The
very fact that the rough children of the poor would use these
places was an argument in favour of their provision.&nbsp; A
healthy body meant not only a healthy mind, but a contented mind;
and with recreation grounds for their use the children might be
expected to grow up amenable to proper and right feelings, and in
every sense better members of the community.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Believing as he did in the doctrine of <i>salus populi
suprema lex</i>, he earnestly recommended the Council to take
some steps in the direction he had indicated.</p>
<p>He concluded by moving&mdash;&ldquo;That this Council,
recognising the duty of providing recreation grounds for the
children of Norwich, appoints a special committee to consider and
report as to the best means of carrying out this
resolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Committee of the Council was then at once appointed.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;At this date there were
practically no public recreation grounds.&nbsp; At the present
time we have the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Mousehold Heath, 150 acres.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Chapel Field Gardens.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Castle Gardens.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Gildencroft.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Waterloo Park.</p>
<p class="gutindent">South Heigham, 6 acres.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Woodlands Plantation (given by Mrs.
Pym).</p>
<p class="gutindent">Lakenham and St. Martin&rsquo;s Bathing
Places and Grounds.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Eaton Park, 80 acres.</p>
<p>Besides the numerous smaller spaces and churchyards which have
been re-arranged and planted, and made both pleasing and (many of
them) suitable for outdoor use or rest.&nbsp; For the promotion
and carrying out of these, we are most largely indebted to Mr.
Edward Wild, Mr. W. E. Hansell, and the Rev. J. Callis, with one
or two others.</p>
<p>This and the next following Address were the outcome of the
very strong impression produced upon the Author by observing the
puniness or physical inferiority of much of the poor population
with whom he had to deal as Physician to the Norwich Dispensary,
when first coming to Norwich, as compared with that of the
neighbouring country district where he had formerly
resided.&nbsp; It appeared to him that want of outdoor exercise
and the public-house habit were the main causes of this
difference.&nbsp; And hence these two subjects of Recreation and
Temperance at once engaged his attention, as they have continued
to do ever since.</p>
<p>How such views have now developed, and also that of the
necessity of good air and exercise for the young, in order to
normal adult health and vigour, is patent to all.</p>

ON TEMPERANCE AND AIDS TO TEMPERANCE.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">An Address given at the Parochial Hall, South
Heigham, in March, 1879, at a meeting held for the purpose of
forming for the parish a branch of the Church of England
Temperance Society, the Rev. J. Callis, Vicar, presiding.</p>
<p class="gutsumm">Reprinted from the <i>Norwich Mercury</i> of
March 5th, 1879.</p>
<p>The evils of excessive drinking are vast and widespread.&nbsp;
As doctors, we are constantly being brought face to face with
them&mdash;in injured health, in wasted life, in ruined
homes.&nbsp; Much has been said, and will doubtless be said again
to-night, on these points; and the desirability of a Temperance
Society for this, as for other parishes, will be enforced.&nbsp;
But believing that our object is to promote temperance in every
possible way, I shall to-night allude to some of those social
conditions which necessarily have a great bearing upon this
important question.</p>
<p>Now, it is well known that much difference of opinion has
existed as to the influence exerted by fermented liquors when
taken in small or reasonable quantities, some thinking that in
these small quantities they are pleasant and practically
harmless; others holding that in no quantity are they either
necessary or even free from injurious effects.&nbsp; Whatever may
be the absolute truth of either of <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>these opinions in reference to a
limited use of these liquors, I think all are of one mind as to
their pernicious effects when taken in any considerable
quantity.&nbsp; All are agreed that drunkenness is a vice,
baneful to the individual, hurtful to his friends; while doctors
and physiologists are unanimous in asserting it to be positively
proved that a too free use of them not only produces the
outwardly injurious effects with which we are so familiar, but
also gradually induces such degenerative disease of various
internal organs as undermines the health and materially shortens
the existence of the individual.&nbsp; With such a conflict of
opinion still existing, our society wisely declines to decide
that which science has been unable to settle, and opens wide her
doors, and asks both these classes of thinkers to come in.&nbsp;
She invites one section of her members to do no violence to their
views of what constitutes temperance, or of the right way of
influencing their neighbours.&nbsp; She merely asks them to join
this society, and simply pledge themselves to practice and
encourage that temperance as to which everyone may agree.&nbsp;
But she tries to speak more mildly to those who are travelling in
the well-trod road of Intemperance, which leads to mental and
bodily ruin; and she entreats them to embrace the only means yet
known which can save them from their destructive course.&nbsp;
She asks them to pledge themselves to endeavour, by entire
abstinence from the destroying drink, to save themselves from the
miserable end to which they are hastening.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself and of myself, although a very moderate
and small drinker, I am not an abstainer. <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>But though believing that many
persons may take a small quantity of fermented liquor without
being the worse for it, I also know that to many persons even a
small quantity is more or less injurious; whilst as to others, I
can but repeat what has been so often said before, and I do it
with the greatest possible emphasis, that to many alcohol is a
positive poison, unsuited to their temperaments, destructive to
their health, and productive of the worst evils, both morally and
physically.&nbsp; It is curious to notice, in passing, not only
that the use of wine is alluded to through a large part of the
Bible history, but also that the injurious effects of it seem
always to have been precisely the same in character as those
which are so much dilated on in the present day.&nbsp; Dr.
Richardson, perhaps the greatest living exponent of the
physiological properties of alcohol, and the greatest denouncer
of its habitual use, speaks of its effects according to the
increased quantities in which it is used.&nbsp; He describes its
influence thus:&mdash;&ldquo;In the first stage of
alcoholism,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, in small quantity, he says,
&ldquo;it tends to paralyse the minute blood vessels, producing
their relaxation and distension, illustrated by the flush seen on
the face of those who have (in familiar language) been drinking,
by the redness of the eyes and nose,&rdquo; etc., etc.&nbsp; This
stage of excitement, he describes as being followed&mdash;if the
quantity be increased&mdash;by some loss of muscular power, with
disturbance of the reasoning powers and of the will; whilst again
a further quantity produces a complete collapse of nervous
function, when the drunken man, who previously, perhaps, had been
excited, talking loud, and staggering in his walk, becomes
stupid, helpless, and falls into a heavy sleep.&nbsp; And are we
not all familiar with the quotations:&mdash;&ldquo;His eyes shall
be red with wine&rdquo;; &ldquo;Wine is a mocker; strong drink is
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>raging&rdquo;; &ldquo;They are out of the way through
strong drink, they err in vision, they stumble in
judgment&rdquo;; &ldquo;They shall drink and make a noise as
through wine&rdquo;; &ldquo;Who hath woe?&nbsp; Who hath
sorrow?&nbsp; Who hath contentions?&nbsp; Who hath redness of
eyes?&nbsp; They that tarry long at the wine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
adder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who have taken the trouble to read Dr.
Richardson&rsquo;s lectures on alcohol, will see that the effects
of wine, as thus described long ages ago, are identical with
those which he found experimentally to result from alcohol at the
present day; and the redness of the eyes, the contentions and
quarrelling, the loss of judgment, and the ulterior disastrous
results to the health, spoken of in the infallible Word, are only
too familiarly known at the present day.&nbsp; Nor let it be said
that wine is not the beverage of the multitude at the present
time.&nbsp; For this point has also been experimentally
investigated by Dr. Richardson, and he found that whatever the
alcoholic drink, or whatever the adulterations, the effect of
these variations was insignificant, and that the real evil
results of drinking were always due to the alcohol contained in
the fermented liquors, whether these were wine, beer, or ardent
spirits.&nbsp; But the subject of drinking and its evil
influences, both physical and moral, has now been so long and so
often placed before the public, that I shall gladly employ the
short time left to me in alluding to some suggestions which have
been made, with a view to assist in remedying the drinking habits
of the people, and to enable them to wean themselves from these
where no hope of voluntary or total abstention on a large scale
can reasonably be hoped for.&nbsp; These suggestions have been
very numerous.&nbsp; The first and most sweeping suggestion is
the well-known one, which ignores every <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>other
consideration but the evil effects of the excessive use of
alcohol, and proposes to get rid of drunkenness by rendering it
impossible to get the drink.&nbsp; Legislation tending to this
end was tried, as is well known, in America, under the title of
the Maine Liquor Law, but its success has not been such as to
induce other localities to follow the example.&nbsp; Again,
systems of partial restriction, such as are known as the
Gothenburg system, have been tried, or proposed, in the form of a
Permissive Bill, such as has been advocated by Sir Wilfrid
Lawson; but neither of these have commended themselves to the
judgment of mankind as being the right solution of this
question.&nbsp; The fact is social man and mankind constitute a
large question.&nbsp; Over indulgence is not limited to the
cravings of the stomach.&nbsp; Vice would not be eradicated by
the simple removal of beer, however much assisted by it, and man
would not be at once raised to the desired moral level were
public-houses at once abolished.&nbsp; And so out of this
conviction have arisen the various efforts which have been made,
and are being persistently made, to attain, or assist in
attaining, the wished-for results by more gradually acting moral
means.&nbsp; These means, or aids to temperance, as I would call
them, embrace several distinct influences, all of which such a
temperance society as this is calculated to exert.&nbsp; They
consist, primarily, in diffusing among the population, by
meetings, by speeches, and by writings, a thorough knowledge of
the personal evil which such habits necessarily and inevitably
produce; (1)&nbsp; By bringing to bear the influence which
friends and neighbours, so instructed, can exercise; (2)&nbsp; By
forming public opinion and rendering it so forcible that the
general mass of individuals must needs bow to its dictates; and,
lastly, by these and all other assisting <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>means,
endeavouring to strengthen the personal control of self, and to
make the individual himself contribute entirely to, not only his
own good, but, by his improved example, to that of his neighbours
and the community at large.&nbsp; I trust that through the force
of public opinion it will soon be thought by the working classes
as vulgar and as low to get intoxicated, as it now is by those
with more advantages of means and information.</p>
<p>Much has been said and written about the influence which
<i>education</i> is likely to exert in the future upon the habits
of the people.&nbsp; There can be no doubt, I think, that the
influence which will be gradually so exercised will be very
great.&nbsp; A mind trained to better things will abhor and
revolt at the gross pleasure which it would otherwise have
tolerated or enjoyed.&nbsp; And we all (I am sure) rejoice to see
that education is being spread abroad in our land, and that the
rising generation will all, in greater or less degree, have their
minds trained sufficiently to prevent their slumbering in the
lowest abysses of non-development, and to awaken them, and to
lead them to the knowledge at least that there are better
enjoyments in the human body and the human mind than the false
and injurious excitement of incessant alcoholic
stimulation.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, education is like a
tree.&nbsp; It takes a long time for its development, and the
circumstances of the time are too urgent to wait in dependence
alone upon this agency.&nbsp; For all the while that we are
talking, the world is living and acting, and living under such
conditions that, if present customs are to be changed, others and
better ones must be found and provided in substitution for
them.</p>
<p>There is a population to deal with, a people largely and often
exhaustively occupied during the day, and so occupied, that a
large portion of it requires some relaxation <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>in the
evening, after the hours of toil shall have passed away.&nbsp; In
the country districts the difficulty is less; but in the crowded
districts of our large towns, where often many houses, without
any surroundings, exist, and these, when present, often not the
most wholesome or commodious, some means of passing the evening
in reasonable recreation are absolutely necessary.&nbsp; The
richer classes even, in large towns and cities, have felt the
need of their <i>clubs and meeting places</i>, and gradually,
also, working-men have followed this example, and have, in many
places, set up their clubs of various kinds.&nbsp; If anyone
would like to know the demand that exists for evening places of
resort, I would ask him to observe the throngs of people who pour
out of the public-houses on their closing at the hour of eleven
at night.&nbsp; It is not to be supposed that all the frequenters
of these houses of entertainment are drunkards, are even lovers
of strong drink, although, from the constitution of these houses,
they must necessarily drink to pay for the accommodation they
receive; but they use them as clubs, as the only places open to
them in which they can spend their evenings, and in which they
find the light, the warmth, the company, the newspapers, the
interchange of speech, which they crave, and which are there
alone obtainable.&nbsp; This view of the uses to which the
public-house parlour is applied, is confirmed by observation of
what happens when a well-appointed circus or other similar place
of outdoor amusement is located in such a town as Norwich.&nbsp;
For although no drink, good or bad, is sold in the building, yet
it may be seen for weeks together to be nightly thronged by a
company of one, or, perhaps, two thousand people.</p>
<p>Acting upon this idea, and on this principle, there have now
been established in many places public-houses without those
elements which render them undesirable.&nbsp; The <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Caf&eacute;
Company&rsquo;s houses, like to that recently opened in Norwich
(and to which, I am sure, we all wish good speed), in which
provision is made for amusement, for food, and for
non-intoxicating drinks, are of this class, and so are the
establishments of the London Coffee Public-house Association, and
the Coffee Tavern Company, and others.&nbsp; But a recent writer
(Mr. Moggridge, <i>Macmillan</i>, October, 1878) goes much
further, and suggests the trial of the plan of retaining the
present public houses, while keeping their attractive features,
throwing the sale of drink so far into the background that it
shall be the least prominent and important part of the
establishment.</p>
<p>At present, of course, the public-houses exist only or chiefly
in the sale of fermented liquors, and not for the benefit of the
frequenter, whose primary object is often, at least at first, the
enjoyment of the public parlour and its society.&nbsp; The writer
above mentioned proposes, at least for a time, to convert them
into veritable clubs, where fermented drinks can certainly be
obtained, but where they shall by no means be the great and
prominent part of the refreshment provided.&nbsp; He thinks that
then it might be possible gradually to wean a large portion of
their frequenters from their drinking habits, and gradually also
to introduce a better and more harmless system than now
prevails.&nbsp; Whether or not such a scheme as this is
practicable, or even desirable, it appears certain that in any
attempt to close the present houses of public resort, other and
more suitable ones must be provided.</p>
<p>Before quitting this part of the subject, I would desire to
call attention to the laudable attempts already made in two
adjoining parishes to furnish a sort of evening club room for the
use of the poorer parishioners.&nbsp; In <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>one of these
parishes, I believe, the mission room is open for use every
evening, and in the other a commencement has been made by opening
the schoolroom on Saturday evenings.&nbsp; For these, newspapers,
or reasonable games, are essential, and it is probable (as man is
both a hungry and thirsty animal) that if they are to be
permanently successful both food and harmless drinks must be
obtainable; but whether tea and coffee will be sufficient, or
whether some of the various unfermented drinks are required,
which are described in a little book called, &ldquo;A Book of One
Hundred Beverages,&rdquo; I must not now stay to consider.</p>
<p>In England and countries of similar climate, the recreation
difficulty is much greater than in more favoured countries, where
the climate, in a larger portion of the year, admits of the
evening hours being passed in the open air.&nbsp; Here, for
months together, the evenings&rsquo; relaxation must needs be
within doors, and in many towns there is literally no place of
indoor resort but the public-house, and, perhaps, the
theatre.</p>
<p>A great aid to temperance will doubtless be given when, under
the operation of the Artisans&rsquo; Dwelling Act, or other
similar legislation, the character of the worst localities of our
towns improves.&nbsp; It is notorious that the narrower the
streets, the more crowded the courts, and the worse the houses,
the more do gin-palaces flourish, and the more does the
population give itself up to the artificial stimulus of fermented
liquors.&nbsp; And the reason is not far to seek, for if there be
an absence of all comfort at home; if the house be small, and
crowded, and dirty; if the water be bad, and perhaps unsuited for
drinking; if there be no bit of garden in which to lounge, and to
grow a few things in which interest can be taken; if there be
nothing in <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>home to render this agreeable&mdash;then, as a matter of
course, recourse is had to that neighbouring house where nearly
all these conditions are reversed, and dirt, and squalor, and
crowding are exchanged for light, and brightness, and space.</p>
<p>I have said that an English climate is less adapted than many
others to <i>out-of-doors&rsquo; recreations</i> and
amusements.&nbsp; Yet there is, even in England a very
considerable portion of the year in which the existence of public
parks and recreation grounds would contribute very largely to the
promotion of temperance by providing pleasant spots in which to
pass the hours unabsorbed by labour.&nbsp; But, I am sorry to say
that our old city of Norwich has sadly degenerated from the time
of Pepys, and enjoys an unenviable pre-eminence in the entire
absence of these most desirable public spaces within its
boundaries.&nbsp; With the exception of Chapel Field, we have not
a single open public space.&nbsp; There is not a spot where the
lads can play at cricket or football, or where their seniors can
lounge away an evening hour; while as to a public park, the
chance of this appears to grow dimmer and dimmer as the
population of the city spreads and increases.&nbsp; I have
ventured on more than one occasion to call attention to the need
of such places for Norwich, and I have pointed to Mousehold Heath
as a place which should, at all costs, be preserved for the
city.&nbsp; But time passes.&nbsp; Several available spots for
public recreation grounds have, one by one, been absorbed for
building purposes, and Mousehold Heath&mdash;a space which
appears to have been specially provided for the health and
salubrity of future Norwich, and whose beauties and capabilities
must surely be unappreciated by our citizens&mdash;is being
gradually devoted to gravel pits, to brick kilns, and&mdash;to
destruction.&nbsp; And let it not be supposed that <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the
temperance of a population has no relation to its health and its
general welfare.&nbsp; Beyond the attractions of a fresh and open
spot, as a counter attraction to the public-house, the growth of
a strong and healthy population tends powerfully in the direction
of temperate habits, for the feeble and weakly will naturally
seek indoor resorts, whilst the strong and the muscular will
equally surely seek the open air.&nbsp; I wish I could think that
Norwich was not suffering from this cause.&nbsp; But whoever
observed the generally puny appearance, the poor <i>physique</i>,
and the frequently strumous aspect of many of the children and
youth received into our schoolrooms during the late flood, and
many of whom came from the most crowded parts of the city, must
have been struck with the evidence they afforded of the want that
existed for them of light, of air, and of healthy exercise.</p>
<p>Lest I should be thought to be dwelling too long on a subject
of little importance, or little bearing upon this night&rsquo;s
proceedings, let me read over to you a list of those places in
England (and I am not sure that it is a complete list) which,
during the past two or three years, have either had presented to
them or have felt it their duty to provide public parks and
recreation grounds for the use of the residents:&mdash;Reading,
Birmingham, Dublin, Wigan, Leicester, Limerick, Lancaster,
Heywood, Derby, Wolverhampton, Leeds, Longton, Torquay,
Sheffield, Swansea, Newcastle, Exeter, and Falmouth.</p>
<p>The only other aid to temperance, to which I will now allude,
is that of <i>public galleries of art and natural history</i>,
and so forth.&nbsp; These are but small aids, but still they are
appreciable ones, and I would gladly see such in Norwich.&nbsp; I
do not know how far the disused gaol would be convertible to such
public purposes, but it has struck me that the site is an
admirable one, and the space ample <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>for the collection in one spot, of an
art gallery, museum, free library, popular lecture rooms, and for
any other purposes which might properly come under the heading of
popular instruction.&nbsp; The former city gaol has long been
used as a public library.&nbsp; It would be a happy change if the
late one could now be devoted, not to the punishment but the
prevention of crime; not to the expiation of the results of
indulgence in drink, but to the better training of men&rsquo;s
minds, so as to teach them, by instinct and by culture, to avoid
the destructive paths of vice and of excess.</p>
<p>I think, sir, I have said enough to show how large is this
temperance question, in which we are all, in which, indeed, the
whole community, is so greatly interested.&nbsp; In proof of its
recognised importance, we may point to the fact that doctors,
physiologists, ministers of religion, peers of the realm, and
even a Prime Minister, have raised their voices in opposition to
the progress of the crying evil of drunkenness.&nbsp; Many
earnest men have striven, by the influence of their continued
advice, and by the example of their personal abstention from
intoxicating liquors, to help on the good work; and many others
have done so in various indirect ways, and especially by efforts
to ameliorate the condition of the people, and provide for them
alternative means of harmless and rational occupation or
amusement.&nbsp; These efforts are so persistent and now so
general; they are founded upon such complete knowledge, and such
recognised necessity, that they cannot fail rapidly to produce
good fruit, and I believe they have already produced some good
fruit in Norwich.&nbsp; But as social knowledge ripens, as
acquaintance with the means of securing the general well-being
increases, so we may hope that the difficulties attending the
reformation of evil habits will lessen; and <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>although we
may not hope to see established a condition of houses, of
streets, of towns, of food and drink, of labour, and of all those
conditions which would render human life and surroundings ideally
perfect, yet continuous efforts must be made to realise for the
community such moral and physical surroundings as shall conduce
to their welfare in the highest possible degree.&nbsp; And to
this end, let us be sure that nothing will contribute so much as
that soberness and temperance which it is the object of this
Church of England Society to encourage and inculcate.</p>

ON TORTOISES. <a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a></h2>
<p>I have almost to apologize for bringing before so learned and
critical a Society as this, the few notes and observations I have
made upon the &ldquo;manners and customs&rdquo; of my pair of
common land Tortoises, partly because I feel that much of what I
have observed must also have been observed by other members of
this Society; and still more because (as is well known) that
incomparable master both of observation and
expression&mdash;White of Selborne&mdash;has already noted, and
placed upon record, the most interesting of the habits of these
creatures.</p>
<p>Mine is thus necessarily a &ldquo;twice-told
tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can only hope that the never flagging
interest which naturalists take in the observation or record of
the habits of animals, will suffice to make them bear with me for
the short time I shall detain them.</p>
<p>I have in my garden two of the common land Tortoises
(<i>Testudo Gr&oelig;ca</i>), and these have been in my
possession three and four years respectively.</p>
<p>I purchased them from the barrow of a hawker in Norwich
streets, in two following years&mdash;one being a little larger
than the other, and they are in consequence <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>known by the
names of the <i>old gentleman</i> and the <i>young
gentleman</i>.</p>
<p>Although selected as the best from a number of others, I am
sorry to say that they both appeared to be ill or greatly
injured, and it was a considerable time before they recovered
sufficiently either to begin to take food, or to move about with
their proper freedom, or with the well-known liveliness of
Tortoises!</p>
<p>Another Tortoise, which I purchased, did actually die a short
time afterwards, having lived in a state of semi-stupor for the
intervening period; and I fear that the capability of these
creatures for suffering is not much recognised in the usual
methods of their conveyance and treatment.</p>
<p>The two Tortoises which survived have, as I said, now lived on
my premises and thriven for three and four years.&nbsp; They have
become almost pets.&nbsp; They most evidently recognise the place
as their home.&nbsp; They know the various localities of the
garden perfectly.&nbsp; They know the sunny spots to which to go
at suitable times to bask.&nbsp; They know where to find sun, and
where to find this and shade combined, when they so desire it;
and they return, afternoon after afternoon, to the same cosy, and
dry, and sheltered spots, under the dry ivy of the wall, or
elsewhere, which they have often previously selected as their
night&rsquo;s abode.</p>
<p>It is very plain that they have some recognition of
individuals.&nbsp; For instance, if Lady Eade and myself are both
preparing to feed them, they will constantly leave me and walk
off to her&mdash;doubtless because she is more in the habit of
bringing them their favourite kinds of food than I am.</p>
<p>They appear to be quick of <i>sight</i>, but show very little,
if any, sign of having any impressions conveyed to them by <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the sense of
<i>hearing</i>.&nbsp; They evidently possess a full sense of
<i>taste</i>, for they discriminate instantly between food they
like, and that which is less palatable to them.</p>
<p>The daily <i>habits</i> of these creatures are certainly very
staid and methodical, and vary but little, except as the season
of the year, and the warmth of the day, vary.</p>
<p>They are often, in the height of summer, quite early risers,
and on sunny mornings will often be up, and perambulating the
garden, and nibbling the little trefoil leaves found amongst the
grass, by seven or six o&rsquo;clock, or even earlier.&nbsp; But,
I must say, that these early habits are quite limited to the very
finest weather; and it has seemed that in the matter of early
activity, these animals always err, if at all, on the side of
care and caution.&nbsp; They never leave their beds, or the
neighbourhood of cover, if there is the slightest appearance of
cloudiness or rain, at least until the day is well up; and for a
large portion of their year the time for coming forth is not
until eight, nine, or ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>In electrical weather they are never lively, even though the
day be intermittingly hot and bright; and at such times they are
often almost lethargic, and show great indifference as to
feeding.</p>
<p>They appear to have an extreme and instinctive objection to
rain.&nbsp; Cloudy weather makes them dull.&nbsp; A passing cloud
will make them discontinue eating.&nbsp; And the passage of a
person or object suddenly between them and the sun will cause
them as suddenly to draw in their heads.&nbsp; The dislike of
clouds and their accompaniments is therefore a very marked
instinct with them.</p>
<p>If not fed, they will go and help themselves, not to grass,
but to some white Clover growing with the grass in the garden; or
in default of this, to some of the garden plants&mdash;by
preference the fleshy-leaved ones, such as the <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Echiveria or
Sedum&mdash;after which they will retire to some warm place, and
bask in the sun.&nbsp; They have a special liking for the warm
vine-border in front of my greenhouse; and if the day be not too
hot, they will tilt themselves up edgeways against the south wall
of the greenhouse, or upon the edge of some tuft of flowers; or
if the sun is too warm, they will then cover their heads up with
leaves or earth on the bed, leaving their backs uncovered and
exposed to the heat.&nbsp; (In this respect they seem to remind
us of the habits of the tiger in his jungle.)</p>
<p>But they appear greatly to prefer being fed, and having their
food found for them; indeed further, one, at least, much prefers
to have his food held up to him, and almost put into his mouth
when he opens it.</p>
<p>They take their food with a snapping movement; masticate it
little if at all; and when feeding themselves, cut or tear it
with the sharp-hooked anterior portion of the upper jaw.</p>
<p>In the hottest weather their appetites are very fine (thus
they will eat several large Lettuce leaves at one time), and they
bear a close relation to the warmth and clearness of the day, and
the period of the year.</p>
<p>Their favourite foods are&mdash;besides Trefoil, already
mentioned, and garden flowers&mdash;Lettuces, Dandelions, French
Beans, etc.&nbsp; They are much attracted by yellow blossoms, and
greedily eat those of the Dandelion and Buttercup.&nbsp; One of
my creatures is very fond of sliced Apple, though the other will
not eat it.</p>
<p>But the vegetable of which they are most fond is the Green
Pea.&nbsp; Both of them will leave all other food for this, and
they will consume at a meal a very considerable number of these
Peas.&nbsp; Indeed, so fond are they of them, that they will
follow a person accustomed to feed them <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>with them
about the garden, and will even try to clamber up his legs to get
at them.</p>
<p>After sleeping and basking, they will again eat, and then
again sleep once or twice more during the day; but in cooler or
doubtful weather, they usually eat only once a day, and sometimes
not at all.</p>
<p>Although those who hawk Tortoises about the streets will often
tell purchasers to put them into their kitchens that they may eat
Beetles and Cockroaches, I believe it to be well understood that
they are intrinsically vegetable feeders; a position well put by
Frank Buckland, who says that Tortoises put into a kitchen to eat
Beetles will in due time die of starvation, and then most
probably the Beetles will eat them.&nbsp; Certainly ours never
eat anything but vegetable food.&nbsp; But a Tortoise in a
neighbouring garden does every morning consume a very substantial
quantity of bread and milk, or rather bread well-soaked in milk,
and he appears to thrive well upon it.&nbsp; Our Tortoises never
drink water, and are decidedly not tempted to drink by milk being
offered to them.</p>
<p>Whatever the season, the Tortoises retire very early to
bed.&nbsp; The warmth and sunniness of the day appear to regulate
the exact time, but they rarely remain up after three or four
o&rsquo;clock, and in the cooler seasons, or on dull days, they
retire much earlier.</p>
<p>They will go day after day to the same warm and leafy nook;
and they have a habit on rising in the morning of simply turning
out of bed, and lying for a time just outside of their bed-place,
with their heads stupidly stretched out, or staring vacantly up
into the air, before entering upon the serious business of the
day. <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>I
should say their <i>Memory</i> is very strong.&nbsp; I have said
they remember persons.&nbsp; They remember places they know, and
if carried away will march straight off and back again to the
place they wish to go to; and what is more remarkable, when
brought out in the spring after seven or eight months&rsquo;
hybernation, they do exactly as they did the day before they went
to sleep; and will march off as direct to the old spots as if
they had only had one day&rsquo;s interregnum.</p>
<p>As a further instance of memory or intelligent knowledge, we
are constantly in the habit, in the cooler weather, of putting
them to bed under a mat in the greenhouse; and we very constantly
find them, in the morning, waiting by the greenhouse door to be
let out, clearly remembering that this is the place by which they
will have to pass into the open air.</p>
<p>They do not appear to care much for each other&rsquo;s
society&mdash;(I believe they are both males)&mdash;but they do
not fight.&nbsp; Neither are they respecters of each
other&rsquo;s persons, for they walk over each other&rsquo;s
backs in the most indifferent way, if either happens to be in the
direct road of the other&rsquo;s progression.</p>
<p>One of the creatures is certainly fond of climbing.&nbsp; We
have several times found him mounted (when shut up in the
greenhouse) upon the other&rsquo;s back; or upon an inverted
flower-pot; and once we found him in a most pitiable condition
through the exercise of these scandent aspirations.&nbsp; He had
evidently been endeavouring to climb up some flower sticks placed
slantingly against the wall, and in doing this he had turned over
upon his axis; and when we found him he was reclining upon his
back against these sticks, and standing upon one hind foot,
whilst with the other, and with his fore feet, he was making
frantic efforts to reinstate himself <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>in a more comfortable position.&nbsp;
As so placed he reminded us irresistibly and ludicrously of a
huge toad held up by a fore leg.</p>
<p>Our Tortoises have certainly got tempers.&nbsp; They hiss when
they are meddled with.&nbsp; They resist and try to scratch, or
otherwise hurt, when lifted up from their place of repose; and
they exhibit distinct petulance, and will jerk themselves forward
out of your hand when you are again placing them upon the
ground.</p>
<p>They are also very particular when going to their evening
places of repose, and most distinctly refuse to go to rest in the
place in which you try to place them, however comfortable this
may appear to be, even if they have previously selected this spot
for themselves day after day.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin speaks of a large kind of Tortoise which is reputed
to be able to walk at the rate of sixty yards in ten minutes;
<i>i.e.</i>, three hundred and sixty yards in the hour, or four
miles a day.&nbsp; I have twice timed the rate of progress of one
of my Tortoises.&nbsp; Once it walked ten feet in the minute, and
another time twenty feet in the minute.&nbsp; This latter is at
the rate of twelve hundred feet, or four hundred yards, in the
hour; or of a mile in between four and five hours.&nbsp; This
truly is not quite the ordinary rate of the hare&rsquo;s
progress, but I think they can cross a certain small distance of
ground much more rapidly than we should at first suspect.</p>
<p>Once more.&nbsp; These creatures distinctly grow in size from
year to year.&nbsp; Our two measure respectively seven and seven
and a half inches in length.&nbsp; And they must have elongated
fully an inch in the three and four years of our possession.</p>
<p>I weighed them this year, on May 29th, soon after their waking
up for the summer, and again on September 8th.&nbsp; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>They weighed
in May, 2 lbs. 7&frac12; ozs. and 2 lbs. 3&frac12; ozs.; a
fortnight ago they weighed 2 lbs. 10 ozs. and 2 lbs. 5 ozs.;
having thus gained in weight through their summer feeding
2&frac12; ozs. and 1&frac12; ozs. respectively. <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>When the due period arrives in which they naturally bury
themselves, and so surround themselves with earthen bulwarks, and
then retire for the winter into their carapace castles, we put
them down into a cupboard in the cellar.</p>
<p>Mr. White remarks that his Tortoise did not bury itself into
the ground before November 1st, but ours are cold and torpid, and
quite ready to hybernate by the first week in October.&nbsp;
Probably the different latitude and longitude of Selborne and
Norwich may account for this difference of time.</p>
<p>In this cellar cupboard, the Tortoises remain until the end of
April, when, though still dull and stupid, the weather is getting
sufficiently warm for them to enjoy the sun for a portion of the
day.&nbsp; But the frosts and cold of this period of the year are
still dangerous.&nbsp; And a relative of mine lost both of his
old friends (who for years had taken care of themselves in the
winter in his garden) during the cold weather of this spring,
after they had duly survived the far greater cold of the winter
in the ground places in which they had buried themselves.</p>
<p>From October to April&mdash;fully seven months&mdash;they rest
from their labours of eating, of breathing, shall I say, of
thinking? (or nearly so, for they occasionally stir a little, and
are found to have moved a little from under their straw).&nbsp;
But they neither eat nor drink, nor see light, nor <a

open their eyes.&nbsp; And when touched during this time they
feel of a stony coldness, and certainly appear to have none of
their faculties in operation.</p>
<p>But with the warmer weather, they again gradually resume the
precise habits of the preceding year.&nbsp; Gradually, their
bright little eyes resume their intelligence; their memory
re-awakens; and they return to the ways, and the habits, and the
places of the preceding season, as if their sleep of seven months
were but a single night, and last summer verily but as
yesterday.</p>
<p>They are in many respects both curious and remarkable
animals.&nbsp; We find them to have enough of intelligence,
enough of quaintness, and apparently enough of affection, to give
them considerable interest in the eyes of their owners, and to
raise them out of the level of despised reptiles.&nbsp; Whilst
their remarkable construction, and mysterious power of
hybernation, render them specially worthy of study and
contemplation.</p>
<p>These specialities and peculiarities must be my much-needed
excuse for having troubled you so long with these few details of
their personally observed habits and ways.</p>

A FURTHER NOTE UPON TORTOISES. <a name="citation38"></a><a
href="#footnote38" class="citation">[38]</a></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">In the year 1886 I read before this Society a
paper in which I recorded some of the observed habits and
peculiarities of a pair of Tortoises which I had then kept in my
garden for three and four years respectively.&nbsp; This paper
was afterwards published in our Society&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Transactions&rdquo; (Vol. iv. p. 316), and will probably
be remembered by some of our members.</p>
<p>I would like this evening to say a few further words upon
these creatures, which are still living and in my
possession&mdash;more particularly with reference to their
<i>rate of growth and increase</i>.</p>
<p>The two Tortoises have now been in my possession ten and nine
years respectively.&nbsp; Six years ago I reported to this
Society that <i>they measured</i>, the one 7&frac12; and the
other 7 inches in <i>length</i>.&nbsp; Now at the end of six
further years their antero-posterior measurements are 9&frac12;
and 9 inches respectively&mdash;the measurements being made from
before backwards over the convex surface of the carapace.&nbsp;
They have, therefore, each of them, thus measured, increased
exactly two inches in length in the last six years, or at the
rate of exactly one-third of an inch per year.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>(The
under flat surface of the shell now measures 6&frac12; and
6&frac14; inches from before backwards.&nbsp; These Tortoises are
said not usually to exceed 10 inches in entire length.)</p>
<p>Then as to their <i>weight</i>.&nbsp; I have now kept an exact
record of their respective weights in the spring and autumn of
each of the past seven years, <i>i.e.</i> their weight on
commencing to hybernate in October or November, and again their
weight on returning afresh to light and more active existence in
April or May of the following spring.&nbsp; And it is interesting
to notice how almost continuously they have increased both in
size and weight; and also how corresponding are the alterations,
or otherwise, in the consecutive years, both of spring and
autumn, of the two animals.</p>
<p>In my former paper, I mentioned that during the summer months
of 1886, when I first weighed them, <i>i.e.</i> from May to
September, my Tortoises had gained in weight, the one 2&frac12;
ounces, and the other 1&frac12; ounces; whilst each of them
became lighter in the following winter by 2&frac12; ounces.&nbsp;
Since that time the spring and autumn weighings have been
regularly continued, and the result is shown in the following
table.</p>

<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>In the
seven years, therefore, 1886 to 1892, the larger Tortoise has
increased in weight from 2 lbs. 10 ozs. to 3 lbs. 3&frac12; ozs.;
and the smaller Tortoise from 2 lbs. 5 ozs. to 2 lbs. 14&frac12;
ozs., giving a total increase of weight in this period of exactly
9 ounces for each animal, or an average annual increase of about
1 ounce and 5&frac12; drachms (avoirdupois).</p>
<p>The general result also of the above weighings is to show
that, in average seasons in England, these creatures gain from 2
to 2&frac12; ounces in each summer, and lose again a varying but
considerable portion of this increase during the ensuing six or
seven months of hybernation; but, on the whole, showing an
average gain of a little more than one ounce in the
year&mdash;the average gain of weight per month in summer working
out at about 6 or 7 drachms, with an average loss in the winter
months of about 4 or 5 drachms per month.&nbsp; This last fact
scarcely agrees with Cuvier&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;during
winter . . . their loss of substance amounts almost to
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be noted that the foregoing table shows certain
variations in the increases and decreases of weight in the
several years; also that in two of the years there was but little
change between the autumn and spring weights&mdash;this period of
stagnation occurring in both animals simultaneously.&nbsp;
Probably several causes for this were at work, but I have little
doubt that the variability of our English seasons is by far the
largest factor in the case; and that the variations in the
gainings and losings of the different summers and winters depend
very largely upon the special character of these seasons.&nbsp;
Thus, when the summer months are hot the Tortoises eat much more
abundantly and constantly, and consequently put on (or rather put
inside their skeletons) much more <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>flesh than in colder seasons.&nbsp;
On the contrary, a warm autumn, with the temperature not
sufficiently cold to make them go early and thoroughly to sleep,
must conduce to greater loss, or rather waste, of their flesh,
for it is well known that these animals cease to eat many weeks
before they finally retire to rest for the winter; and
necessarily during this period, especially on sunny days in which
(even at this season) they are often moderately lively and
active, they are doubtless breathing and consuming some of the
material which has been stored up for winter consumption.&nbsp;
Whilst again, in a very mild winter or spring they will, as is
well known, frequently wake up from their dormancy, and of
course, on each such occasion will make further inroads upon
their reservoir of nutrient material.</p>
<p>It is therefore pretty certain that hot summers and cold
winters are most conducive to their rapid increase in size and
weight; whilst of course the contrary conditions would have an
exactly opposite result.</p>
<p>Cetti says that the common Greek Tortoise seldom weighs above
3 lbs.&nbsp; My larger one now weighs 3 lbs. 3&frac12; ozs., and
is still growing.&nbsp; But there is a Tortoise now in this city
which weighs as much as 6 lbs. 5 ozs.&nbsp; I judge, however,
from its size and form, that it may be a variety of the common
Tortoise.&nbsp; This creature must be not only &ldquo;an old
inhabitant of this city,&rdquo; but thoroughly naturalised into a
British subject, as it is known to have lived in Norwich for at
least thirty years.</p>
<p>I have little to add to what I previously said (and to what
White has said) as to Tortoise habits and manners.&nbsp; These
appear to be very uniform, and to be guided by a most definite
instinct; and it is very noticeable and very remarkable how the
two Tortoises will constantly <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>both do the very same thing at the
very same time, often almost at the same moment of time.&nbsp;
For example, when feeding, even when apart from each other, they
will constantly suddenly leave off eating almost at the same
instant; or they will in like manner, when basking in the sun,
both at once get up and walk off to some other place; or they
will both all at once suddenly get up and march off to their
evening place of shelter and rest&mdash;and this without any
definite atmospheric or other cause that is appreciable.</p>
<p>Cuvier has well called the Tortoise &ldquo;<i>un animal
retourn&egrave;e</i>,&rdquo; an animal inverted, or &ldquo;turned
inside out, or rather outside in.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is said
that the large Land Tortoise, when withdrawn into its shell,
&ldquo;can defy the whole animal world except man, from whom
nothing is safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with reference to this point I
have observed that our Tortoises, when retiring to rest, always
take the greatest care to protect their noses and the anterior
opening of their shells.&nbsp; When they burrow, their head is of
course covered up by the earth.&nbsp; But when, as is often the
case in the warmer weather, they simply go to sleep in some
sheltered place, they habitually place their heads close against
the wall, or under the projecting roots of a tree or shrub, so as
not to leave this part exposed.&nbsp; I presume, therefore, that
they are conscious of some insecurity, and it would certainly
appear that their heads would otherwise be open to the attack of
rats or other predaceous animals.</p>
<p>Professor Forbes describes the peculiar way in which he has in
Greece observed the Tortoises to do their courting, <i>i.e.</i>
the method by which the male Tortoise seeks to attract the
attention of his lady-love, namely, by repeatedly knocking his
shell violently against hers.&nbsp; I have noticed the same
process in my own garden.&nbsp; Both my animals are, I <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>believe,
males.&nbsp; But I have observed one of them, when in an amorous
humour, to strike the other several times in succession a
sounding blow on its shell; and this he does by suddenly
withdrawing his head into his shell, so as to be out of
harm&rsquo;s way, and then as suddenly throwing his body forward
by a sort of butting process against the shell of his
fellow.&nbsp; This proceeding causes a very considerable, and
indeed, comparatively speaking, quite a loud and resounding
noise; and at first sight these sudden and severe blows would
appear to be more calculated to cause corporeal discomfort or
injury than to excite affection.&nbsp; These very marked
attentions are usually followed by the utterance of a quick and
soft, or almost whining cry.</p>
<p>I will only add that my Tortoises show an increasing
familiarity and sense of being at home as years roll on.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Addendum</span>.&mdash;On November 2nd,
1905, after a further interval of thirteen years, these Tortoises
had respectively attained to a weight of 4 lbs. and half an
ounce, and 3 lbs. 13&frac12; ozs. as compared with weights of 2
lbs. 10 ozs. and 2 lbs. 5 ozs. in 1886.&nbsp; They are therefore
still growing in size and weight.&nbsp; In October of last year
(1907) they weighed respectively 4 lbs. 2&frac12; ozs. and 4
lbs.</p>

MY CHRISTMAS GARDEN PARTY. <a name="citation44"></a><a
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a></h2>
<p>Norwich is proverbially a City of Gardens, and many of the
houses in St. Giles&rsquo;s Street, including my own, are
fortunate enough to share in the advantage of possessing one of
these valuable urban appendages.</p>
<p>As regards the birds that frequent these gardens, the
neighbourhood of Chapel Field, with its trees and shrubs, is, or
should be, an additional attraction to them; but I am bound to
say that I have not observed so great a congregation, or so large
a variety of birds, in Chapel Field Gardens as might have been
expected.</p>
<p>My own garden consists of a plot of grass of fair size, with
one large apple tree in its centre, a double laburnum tree close
by, and with several other trees of good size on its
confines.&nbsp; Some of the boundary walls are covered with
ivy.&nbsp; In my neighbours&rsquo; gardens are also both trees
and shrubs, whilst Chapel Field is in the immediate vicinity,
just beyond my stable yard.</p>
<p>There is thus a considerable variety of shelter for the birds,
and, doubtless, a proportionate variety of food for them at the
proper seasons.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>In
ordinary years, and in average seasons, the following birds come
into my garden:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Our constant town friends, the Sparrows.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Blackbirds and Thrushes (a pair of each of which
usually build and hatch with me, though I am sorry to say that
their labour and pains are usually devoid of result, as the young
birds are got by the Cats, either in the nest, or as soon as they
leave it).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Starlings.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Robins.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Jackdaws (occasionally&mdash;from the neighbouring
church steeple).</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; At rare intervals I see a little Wren, or Tom-tit,
busily engaged on the above-mentioned laburnum tree, evidently
getting a good meal from what it finds in the bark.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; In the prolonged frosty or snowy weather the garden
is occasionally visited by the Missel-thrush, and now and then
also by</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; A Rook.</p>
<p>In the ordinary way, and in open weather, the <i>number</i> of
my bird visitors is not large, but in the cold winter weather,
and in response to my invitation, this number very considerably
increases, so that at times I must have had as many as
thirty-five or forty feeding in my garden at the same time.&nbsp;
The increase of numbers is chiefly made up of extra Sparrows and
Starlings; and when it occurs the scene is often a very lively
one; the whole of the thirty or forty birds being often assembled
very closely together in active movement; and the grass or garden
path on which they collect is sometimes quite black with their
feathered life.</p>
<p>The prolonged frost of the past winter is fresh in all our
memories.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>On
January 6th, when I specially noted the assemblage of my bird
friends, we had had intermitting frost and snow for about five
weeks, almost continuous snow (with occasional yieldings of the
frost) for a fortnight, and a complete snowy covering up of the
garden ground for a week, with sharp frosts, and often low
temperatures at night.&nbsp; There had been no sun, and,
therefore, no melting of the snow by the wall, or by the hedge
edges, and, consequently, doubtless the natural animal food of
the birds was very scarce and difficult to obtain.&nbsp; Some
food had been thrown to them daily during the greater portion of
this severe weather; but for the preceding week they had been fed
pretty regularly twice daily.</p>
<p>My usual <i>times for feeding</i> had been about 9.30 (after
my breakfast), and about 2 p.m. (after luncheon).</p>
<p>When first fed, the birds&mdash;beginning with the
Sparrows&mdash;seem only to find the food thrown out by accident,
and would drop down by ones and twos, as their instinct or sense
of far-sight appeared to show them that there was food to be
had.&nbsp; But very soon they seemed to remember these fixed
hours, and many of them, especially Starlings, would then be seen
collected on neighbouring trees, or elsewhere, before these
times, evidently ready and waiting for what they were
expecting.</p>
<p>The Sparrows would be chirping in the ivy.&nbsp; The Starlings
would be seen sitting on the watch on a neighbouring tree or
trees, and as soon as the food was thrown down they would
immediately begin to descend upon it.</p>
<p>Yet not all at once, or without due and proper precaution and
inspection.&nbsp; First, the Sparrows&mdash;as the
boldest&mdash;would drop down singly, but in rapid
succession.&nbsp; Then the Starlings would draw nearer one by <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>one, and
carefully look down and inspect the ground.&nbsp; And when one
had summoned courage to descend, the rest would quickly
follow.&nbsp; But, of course, the slightest noise would make the
whole flock suddenly flutter up again into the trees, or into the
next garden, as quickly to return when the alarm was found to be
groundless.</p>
<p>After a little further time, a Thrush or a Blackbird or two
would join the group.&nbsp; Later still, always late, a little
Robin&mdash;quiet, silent, and pathetic&mdash;with its half timid
and half confiding manner, would come into view.&nbsp; Again,
after a further interval, occasionally one of the Jackdaws would
appear upon the scene.&nbsp; And now and then, last of all, a
huge Rook would suddenly descend and carry off some large crust
which the smaller birds had left uneaten&mdash;reserved for more
deliberate pecking at when the crumbs and smaller portions of
food were disposed of.</p>
<p>The manners of these various birds differed strikingly.&nbsp;
The Sparrows, of course, would be first and boldest, and
everywhere.</p>
<p>The Starlings would often form a compact group around the
outspread food, one of them occasionally darting off with a big
morsel or savoury bone.</p>
<p>The Thrushes and Blackbirds would arrive quietly from over the
wall; they would hop about usually on the furthermost outskirts
of the crowd, and as near as possible to their habitual
corner.&nbsp; And the Blackbirds would waggle their tails in
their own quaint manner, and perhaps give their peculiar cry,
whilst both Thrushes and Blackbirds would evidently indicate
their consciousness of superior manners and their greater
dignity, if not their actually more retiring dispositions.</p>
<p>The little Robin, solitary and observant, would come <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>nearer to the
house than the other birds; but his advent was usually too late
for anything but the bare dry remains of the feast left by the
rapacious Sparrows and Starlings.</p>
<p>The Jackdaw would fly straight to the apple tree, perch upon
it, then suddenly descend and seize upon the biggest remaining
morsel; then as quickly fly up again into the tree and try to eat
it there.&nbsp; In this respect, in marked contrast to the Rook,
which in the worst weather would occasionally suddenly arrive and
help himself to the biggest crust left, but he would always at
once fly away with it in his capacious maw.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that my garden party friends have displayed
a very considerable amount of selfishness.&nbsp; Each kind of
bird, of course, selects first the kind of food most appropriate
to it.&nbsp; But there is clear indication that the law of force
prevails amongst them, and that might carries the day against
fairness and right.&nbsp; And it is most clear that neither
Communism, nor Socialism, nor Equality with Fraternity, is a
doctrine in favour with them&mdash;at least in practice.&nbsp; As
long as there is a good supply of the best eatables, my friends
are most communistically amiable to each other.&nbsp; But as soon
as the available supply begins to run short, then the most
barefaced selfishness is the order of the day.&nbsp; The strong
sparrows drive away the weaker ones, or pursue them and steal
from them any dainty little morsel they may have secured and
flown away with.&nbsp; The Starlings dart at each other and
scream, or go through continual &ldquo;fluttering duels&rdquo; in
their efforts to steal their neighbours&rsquo; goods; whilst the
Jackdaws and Rooks have no reserve in displaying their views as
to their practical agreement with Rob Roy&rsquo;s well-known
maxim.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>I have
not observed either the Blackbirds or Thrushes to fight for their
food as the Sparrows and Starlings do.</p>
<p>The Starlings exhibit some other very peculiar ways.&nbsp;
Before descending to feed they will sit upon neighbouring trees
in an attitude of pensive watchfulness&mdash;one irresistibly
reminding one of an old man leaning his head upon one side and
resting it upon his hand.&nbsp; Their peculiar waddling walk or
run and extreme liveliness of manner are well known; but when all
the food is gone, and they return for a short season to their
trees, they will often resume their philosophic or contemplative
attitude&mdash;very soon, however, to disappear to &ldquo;other
fields and pastures new,&rdquo; or in plain English, to some
neighbouring and equally hospitable garden.&nbsp; And their
capacity for food appears to be very great.</p>
<p>The <i>kinds of food</i> which I have thrown to my feathered
friends have been bread and large crusts, oats, the refuse of
meals, scraps of meat, bones of fish or fowls, herring skins,
cheese rinds, portions of fat; and I have found that the animal
matters are very greedily seized upon by nearly all of them,
scarcely excepting the Sparrows.&nbsp; And it is remarkable what
large bones of fish or fowl are rapidly and entirely disposed of;
whilst still larger bones from a joint are picked and cleaned to
the last available particle.&nbsp; Like bird-cannibals that they
are, I observed that some bones from my Christmas Turkey thrown
out to them, appeared to be very specially and particularly
relished by them.&nbsp; When very hungry, not only will Sparrows
eat some kinds of animal food; but Robins, Starlings, and
Jackdaws will all eat bread crumbs and bread crusts.</p>
<p>It is sad to think what a mixed world this is even <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>for birds;
and that even such a happy and interesting town gathering as I
have described is not without its drawback, and this a very
serious one.</p>
<p>Whilst the birds are making the most of their opportunities,
gratifying their natural tastes, and exhibiting their
peculiarities, a Nemesis, or vengeful fate, is constantly hanging
over them, ever ready to overtake them in case of any relaxation
of their habitual watchfulness, in the case of our own or
neighbours&rsquo; Cats.&nbsp; For these fat and feline creatures
seem to be on the watch for their own good Christmas bird cheer;
and with crouching, stealthy steps, and wagging tails, they
actually do now and again succeed in stealing upon their
unsuspecting victims, and in illustrating the inexorable law, as
to food, of animal-feeding creatures.</p>
<p>It is pitiful to see a Sparrow or a Blackbird thus hopelessly
engaged in the clutches of a Cat; and it is a sad interruption or
ending of the scene of joy, if not always of harmony, I have just
described.</p>
<p>Our own pet Cat, though over fed, cannot resist the temptation
of thus stealing upon these birds when the chance occurs, and its
excited movements when watching them through a window, but unable
to get out, are a study in themselves.</p>
<p>To a certain extent the Starlings have now and then a sort of
sentimental revenge; for when very hungry these bold birds will
descend into the kitchen yard close to the house, and carry off
bones and scraps placed there for the use of the said Cat, who
has been seen to watch their theft of its food through the
kitchen window in a state of trembling but helpless excitement,
and evidently of intense disgust.</p>
<p>During all the time of my feedings I could but notice the
wonderful instinct which the birds exhibit, of <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>discovering
the presence of food.&nbsp; Sparrows are everywhere, and
therefore it is not surprising that our home friends should be on
the alert, and should quickly descend upon the feast prepared for
them.&nbsp; But how do their neighbours and more distant friends
so quickly know of it?&nbsp; How do the Starlings, who are not
usually so near at hand, discover the good things available for
them?&nbsp; How does the Jackdaw in the steeple learn of the meat
or bones thrown upon the garden path?&nbsp; Or the Rook in the
distant tree or field of the large crust which the lesser birds
have been unable to dispose of?</p>
<p>It is clear that neither sight nor sound, as we understand
them, would be sufficient to inform and direct them; and that the
most delicate sense of such perception would be insufficient to
enable them to perceive food placed, say, behind a garden
wall.</p>
<p>I have observed that the birds usually arrive pretty
constantly in the following order:&mdash;Sparrows, Starlings,
Thrushes, Blackbirds, Robins, Jackdaws, Rook; though sometimes
neither Jackdaws nor Rook will appear, and often the little Robin
is so extremely late in his arrival that all the suitable food is
eaten up.</p>
<p>The Tit, or Wren, or occasional Finch, seen now and then in
the garden does not condescend to join or associate with such a
mixed Christmas party as I have described, but comes at his own
time, and in his own way.&nbsp; But these little birds have
lately been such rare visitors, that I have not had the
opportunity of making any exact observations upon their manners
and customs in the parish of St. Giles.</p>
<p>I should scarcely have ventured to read these very simple and
very superficial notes to this Naturalists&rsquo; Society this
evening had I not had reason to believe that they would form the
starting-point of far more <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>scientific information about birds
from one or more of its members now present.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>, 1907.&mdash;Some other birds
have occasionally visited my garden, such as Nuthatches,
Redwings, Blackheaded Gulls, and a few others.&nbsp; As to the
Gulls, in January, 1907, after a very heavy and prolonged fall of
snow, some fifty or sixty of these birds, in their winter
plumage, visited my garden and greedily fed upon food (bread or
animal) thrown out to them.&nbsp; And almost filling, as they
did, the grass plot, they formed a very beautiful sight.&nbsp;
Some of these birds in their food-hunting would come almost up to
the drawing-room window.</p>

MY CITY GARDEN IN A &ldquo;CITY OF GARDENS.&rdquo; <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a></h2>
<p>Norwich has long been known by the designation of a
&ldquo;City of Gardens.&rdquo;&nbsp; How long I know not, but we
do know that Evelyn, on his visit to Norwich in 1671, spoke of
the &ldquo;flower gardens in which all the inhabitants
excel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also wrote in his diary that at this visit
he went to see Sir Thomas Browne, whose &ldquo;whole house and
garden was a paradise and cabinet of rarities.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
garden, I believe, at that time extended from his house in the
Market Place (where the late Savings Bank stood) to at least as
far as the present Orford Hill, but no portion of it now
remains.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that so many of the old Norwich
gardens have fallen a prey to the requirements or encroachments
of the builder; and that where ample space and air for flowers
and shrubs, and even trees, formerly existed, there is now
nothing but manufactories or houses with small back premises, or
at the most, little gardens so surrounded by walls as to be
little more than wells, with stagnant air and frequent showers of
chimney blacks.&nbsp; Still, in spite of the rapid increase of
the city, and the gradual absorption of building spaces, we are
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>glad to
know that&mdash;even in the central parts of the city&mdash;some
of the old gardens do yet remain, and that they are still able to
produce much floral beauty, and in many other ways to contribute
to the interest and pleasure of those who are fortunate enough to
possess them.</p>
<p>Of course, my present reference is only to gardens situated in
the older parts of Norwich.&nbsp; Those who live in our suburbs
will doubtless be able to cultivate and utilise their present
gardens as the citizens of Norwich did theirs in the &ldquo;good
old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am glad to say that I (in common with others dwelling in St.
Giles&rsquo;s Street and on St. Giles&rsquo;s Plain) am still one
of the residents in older Norwich with a garden of considerable
size.&nbsp; And in my case this advantage is considerably
enhanced by the immediate proximity of Chapel Field.&nbsp; For
this large open space of seven acres not only provides a great
circulation of air, and so a more healthy vegetation, but
also&mdash;by its numerous and lofty trees&mdash;invites a large
amount of varied and varying bird-life.</p>
<p>As I have now been a dweller in St. Giles&rsquo;s for many
years, it has occurred to me that a few current
notes&mdash;however imperfect and superficial&mdash;on the
capabilities and possibilities of such a central city garden, as
illustrated by these, might possibly be an acceptable
contribution to the proceedings of this our Norwich
&ldquo;Naturalists&rsquo; Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The real object of the paper is to show in a simple way what a
large field these home city gardens, according to their size, may
still afford for observation and intelligent amusement; and how
even in the limited space and depreciated air, which naturally
belong to many of them, they yet afford great opportunities for
the observation of both vegetable and animal life.&nbsp; The
simple grass-plots <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>themselves, however small, when carefully tended and
shaven, are in themselves a constant source of pleasurable
satisfaction; whilst the very worms which inhabit them, and the
birds which feed on these, afford much room for study of some of
nature&rsquo;s methods and instinctive tendencies.</p>
<p>Doubtless the larger space which I possess gives wider
opportunities than smaller gardens.&nbsp; But these must be small
indeed which do not offer full repayment for observation of the
varied life which exists within them, or which may be imported
into them.</p>
<p>My garden is about 60 yards in length, by about 26 yards in
width.&nbsp; It runs nearly north and south.&nbsp; It has walls
of varying height on its several sides.&nbsp; Near to the house
these are covered on one side by trained wisteria and white and
yellow jessamine, but the greater part of the other portions is
covered with ivy.&nbsp; The area of the ground is principally
laid with grass, with a broad gravel walk around it.</p>
<p>Under the east wall is a long terraced rockery, well covered
with suitable plants; and along the west wall runs a broader bed
devoted to very small shrubs and to flowers.&nbsp; The south end,
under a stable wall, contains some very ancient and still
productive apple trees, also two or three beech trees, and an old
pink May-tree, under the shade of which some of the commoner
ferns flourish abundantly.</p>
<p>A vinery, and a verandah utilised as a summer conservatory,
complete this note of the arrangements of my city garden, and
from this brief record it will be seen that an effort has been
made to make every use of the available space and of its several
possibilities.</p>
<p>I do not propose to detain you with any detailed account of
the flowers and plants which can be grown, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>or which
flourish fairly at the present date in this limited city
garden.&nbsp; There are many which are hopeless by reason of the
city air and city soil.&nbsp; And I have found the more delicate
flowers to be so uncertain as to be scarcely worth the trouble of
planting out.&nbsp; Others again fall inevitable victims to the
myriads of autumn slugs.&nbsp; But spring bulbs, the autumn hardy
flowers, and some annuals, as well as the robuster ferns, do
well, and fully repay the trouble of cultivation.</p>
<p>As to ferns, in my former and more open garden higher up the
street, I once had as many as forty different varieties growing
abroad; but, of course, these gradually died out, so that at the
end of four or five years only the common and hardier sorts
remained.&nbsp; Some of these, which were removed, are still very
fine specimens, and have lasted in their new home, as such, for
many years.</p>
<p>It would have been very interesting had any list or catalogue
of Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s &ldquo;paradise&rdquo; of vegetable
rarities been left to us, for a comparison of the possibilities
of a city garden two hundred years ago with those of the present
day, but none such is known to exist.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the fact that several old apple trees exist
in my garden, possibly as old as the house itself, which is
understood to have been built 160 or 170 years ago.&nbsp; And I
would just mention here that beyond the roof of my stable
buildings, and seen conspicuously from my garden,
rises&mdash;nay, towers up towards the sky, that grand old
Aspen-poplar, which is, perhaps, the greatest ornament of the
adjacent Chapel Field, though I think scarcely adequately
appreciated.&nbsp; This tree has a girth of some 15 feet about a
yard above the ground, is 90 to 100 feet high, and was so
remarkable even fifty-eight years ago as to have been then
pictured by Grigor, in <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>his &ldquo;Eastern Arboretum,&rdquo;
as one of the most notable trees in this district.&nbsp; In its
later state a photographic sketch of it is given in my book on
St. Giles&rsquo;s parish, published in 1886, although I fear that
this scarcely adequately pictures its grandeur. <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a></p>
<p>Blomfield states that the great avenue of elm trees in Chapel
Field, also partly visible from my garden, was planted in 1746 by
Sir Thomas Churchman, who is understood to have then lived in my
present house, and who, I believe, then hired the open Chapel
Field of the Norwich Corporation.&nbsp; It may be interesting to
state here that some three or four years ago one of the largest
of that row of elm trees was blown down in a gale.&nbsp; When
this tree was sawn across, I took the trouble to count the rings
which this section displayed.&nbsp; The outer ones were so thin
and irregular that it was not possible to tell their number quite
exactly, but as nearly as I could count the total number was
between 140 and 150.&nbsp; This number, added to the few which
would exist on the young tree when planted, would give a date
approximating very closely to that assigned by Blomfield.&nbsp;
This is an interesting historical fact, though, perhaps, somewhat
irrelevant, and its mention will, I hope, be excused on this
ground.</p>
<p>In my own garden the various trees appear to be healthy, but
some of them increase very slowly.&nbsp; A small pear tree
planted against the ivy-covered wall some twenty years ago is
scarcely larger than when planted there, even although it every
year sends out a full quantity of fresh green shoots.&nbsp; And a
pink thorn tree, transplanted <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>into it a few years ago, actually
remained perfectly quiescent, as if dead, for a whole year, and
then resumed vitality and growth.&nbsp; It is now a vigorous
healthy tree, sending forth every year its normal shoots and
blossoms.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Animal Life</span>.&mdash;Such a garden as
mine affords a considerable opportunity for observing the ways,
and habits, and manners of many <i>animals</i>, none of which are
uninteresting.&nbsp; Shall I weary you by mentioning the
<i>cats</i>, which so often make it their playground, and their
afternoon as well as their nightly meeting-place?&nbsp; Although
I cannot say that <i>caterwauling</i> is harmonious, or
equivalent to the strains of the bands which so agreeably
discourse music in the adjacent Chapel Field on summer evenings,
yet there is much of interest, as well as amusement, to be
derived from noting the varied yet distinct language, and from
watching the very curious customs of the cats themselves,
familiar as these may be to all of us.&nbsp; I am favoured with
visits of cats of all sizes and all colours&mdash;black, grey,
cyprus, sandy, grey and white, and almost all intermediate
shades.&nbsp; And it is certainly curious to watch the
manifestations of their loves and their hates, their friendliness
and their jealousies, their sunny enjoyments and their predatory
instincts, and their methods of attack and defence.&nbsp; These
latter, though often very noisy, by no means necessarily consist
in open fighting, but are very commonly carried on by what Mr. C.
Morris calls the mentality of latter-day life.&nbsp; These
hostile cats (as you have probably observed) will very constantly
settle their relative superiority, not by biting and scratching,
or actual fighting, but by what is actually a &ldquo;staring
match,&rdquo; in which the influence of mind over matter is well
demonstrated.&nbsp; They place themselves a few feet apart, and
stare at each other, until one of them confesses <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>himself
beaten, by slowly backing away from his opponent, and then
suddenly turning round and running away.&nbsp; This is a form of
duelling which might well be copied in human life; and, still
more, might properly be adopted in the case of nations, where
&ldquo;mental&rdquo; arbitration, from a steady calculation of
strength, would take the place of bullets and bayonets.</p>
<p>As with Cats, so with <i>Sparrows</i>; it may be said that
they are constant friends that are always with us.&nbsp; Yet,
though so common, they are a never failing source of interest in
a city garden, if only because they always provide some
conspicuous life and motion; and in mine, because they may nearly
always be heard chirping or quarrelling in the ivy, which covers
so much of the garden walls.</p>
<p>I am sorry that Miss Ormerod gives them such a bad character
as to their appetites.&nbsp; But not being personally engaged in
agriculture, I can only rejoice that nature has provided them
with such strong constitutions, and healthy and active
digestions.&nbsp; Beyond this, it is certainly a pleasure to a
townsman to note their chatterings, their amicable, if noisy,
contentions for the best places in the ivy, their demonstrative
courtships, their dust-baths in the dry ground, or their
water-baths in the pans provided for them for this purpose, and
their evident love for the neighbourhood and companionship (at a
properly regulated distance) of mankind.</p>
<p>What a contrast there is between the active, fluttering, often
noisy <i>House Sparrow</i>, and its quiet, retiring, and
gentle-mannered neighbour, the <i>Hedge Sparrow</i>.</p>
<p>This was well illustrated in the early part of last December,
in this way; the Hedge Sparrow (or Dunnock or Accentor) does not
often visit my garden, but one of these pretty birds did come at
this time, and having <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>incautiously entered the open door of
my greenhouse, got shut up in it.&nbsp; Next morning, on my
entering, it was, of course, somewhat frightened.&nbsp; But
instead of violently fluttering about, and dashing itself against
the window, as the House Sparrow will do in like circumstances,
it very quietly and gently flew away from me, and then at once
dropped down behind the brick flue, where it remained quiet and
concealed, in spite of my efforts to find it, as I desired to do
in order to give it its liberty.&nbsp; The same thing exactly
happened on some following mornings; and being fed regularly, it
has remained there to the present time, <i>i.e.</i> the date of
this paper.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other birds whose visits and whose
peculiarities would provide abundant material for a paper much
longer than I can venture now to inflict upon you.&nbsp; But they
are all welcome for the sake of the varieties of life and habits
they present&mdash;as well as for what Tennyson so prettily
describes as their &ldquo;singing and calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grass-plot is the feeding-ground of the greedy and
quarrelsome <i>Starlings</i>, which will often come for their
meal of worms or other food at quite regular hours, usually at
ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and three to four in
the afternoon.&nbsp; And occasionally the <i>Jackdaws</i>, from
our neighbouring church-steeple, where they live and breed, will
venture&mdash;most carefully and cautiously&mdash;to alight on
the grass in search of food.&nbsp; Whilst even the Norwich
<i>Rooks</i> will, when hard pressed in bad weather, occasionally
dart down from a tree for crusts of bread or other edible matter
obtainable in the garden.</p>
<p><i>Thrushes</i> and <i>Blackbirds</i> are chiefly in evidence
during the nesting season; and it is noticeable how tame or <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>rather
incautious they appear to become during this period.&nbsp; It
would almost seem as if the sitting process produced in them (as
has been noted of other birds) a dullness or partial stupor of
intelligence.&nbsp; Whilst after hatching, the urgent and
continuous calls of their young ones for food evidently renders
their desire to satisfy these imperative and destructive of
prudence.&nbsp; This very year a full-grown Blackbird ventured
along the grass in search of worms almost up to the house
verandah, in which, unfortunately, a cat lay basking; and, as a
matter of course, the bird was instantly pounced upon.&nbsp; She
escaped, however, almost by a miracle, but she left nearly the
whole of her feathers behind her, and almost in a state of
nudity.</p>
<p>It is curious to observe how the Blackbirds and Thrushes will
not only provide worm-food for their nestlings, but how they will
prepare these worms and make them fit for swallowing down the
young throats.&nbsp; They will often, when they have tugged a
worm out of the grass, proceed to peck it into small and suitable
lengths, and will then carry these, arranged in their mouths in
suitable bundles, to the nest.</p>
<p>Blackbirds appear not to gain knowledge by experience, at
least in some particulars.&nbsp; I witness almost every year a
repetition of what I may term &ldquo;the tragedy of the
Blackbirds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evidently the same old birds will yearly
build a nest in almost the same portion of the ivy on one of the
walls, and not more than six or seven feet from the ground.&nbsp;
Well, this is all right so long as the old birds are merely
sitting and make no noise, so as to attract feline
attention.&nbsp; But as soon as the young birds are hatched, and
begin to make vocal demonstrations, of course they fall victims
to their natural enemies and &ldquo;bird-fanciers,&rdquo; and the
nests <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and
their occupants are ruthlessly dragged out from their positions
and destroyed.&nbsp; This occurs year after year.&nbsp; I believe
that then the birds will sometimes build again elsewhere.&nbsp;
But they certainly return to almost the same locality in the
following spring, and their offspring again become victims of the
inappropriateness of their selected homes.</p>
<p>Plenty of other birds also come to the garden at various times
and seasons, and add to its life and
interest&mdash;<i>Robins</i>, <i>Bluetits</i>, <i>Nuthatches</i>,
<i>Redwings</i>, <i>Missel-thrushes</i>, and others&mdash;but of
their behaviour in the winter season, and when habitually fed, I
have already discoursed to this Society, so will not further
trouble you now with their noticeable peculiarities.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Reptiles</span>.&mdash;Perhaps it would
scarcely be expected that the <i>Reptile</i> race would provide
much of interest for a city garden.&nbsp; Yet it may be truly
said that this class of creatures has done almost more than any
other to provide my garden with material for this.</p>
<p>As this Society will know from my previous communications to
its &ldquo;Transactions,&rdquo; I have long kept two <span
class="smcap">Tortoises</span>, and year by year noted their
habits and most remarkable peculiarities.&nbsp; These have been
already fully described in the Society&rsquo;s records, and I can
only now add to what I before stated, that they still continue to
increase in size and weight, and at about the same rate of
progression as twelve or thirteen years ago.&nbsp; They still
gain 1&frac12; to 2 ounces in weight in each summer, and lose
about 1 or 1&frac14; ounce in weight during each winter
hybernation.&nbsp; The total result is, that whilst they weighed
respectively 2 lbs. 10 ozs. and 2 lbs. 5 ozs. in September, 1886,
they weighed in October last 3 lbs. 13 ozs. and 3 lbs. 8 ozs.,
having thus each gained in weight during this period 1 lb. 3
ozs., or on an average about one ounce and a quarter in each
year.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Other
reptilians which I have tried to domesticate (for observation) in
my garden are <span class="smcap">Toads</span> and <span
class="smcap">Frogs</span>.&nbsp; But I am bound to say that I
have not been successful in preserving them in any numbers for
more than a brief period.&nbsp; Their appearance and
disappearance has at times been very mysterious and inexplicable,
but on the whole those which I have imported have, as a rule,
soon either died or been otherwise disposed of.&nbsp; Is it not
probable, I would suggest, that they, or at least the smaller
ones, have fallen a prey to Jackdaws, Rooks, or even
Starlings?</p>
<p>Of the <i>Frogs</i> which I brought home, only one survived
the second year.&nbsp; But this one appeared to thrive in a
remarkable degree for several years.&nbsp; It would apparently
lie dormant for many months, and would then reappear, lively,
fat, and much grown, for a few weeks in the late summer or early
autumn; after which he would be no more seen until the following
year.</p>
<p><i>Toads</i> are more interesting than Frogs; and, indeed, in
a city garden, by no means produce that feeling of loathing which
is popularly supposed to be inherent in them.&nbsp; On the
contrary, they quickly become tame, and almost assume the
<i>status</i> of garden pets.&nbsp; And as a matter of fact, I
entirely disagree with Shakespeare, who calls them &ldquo;ugly
and venomous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the Toads which I imported would come out regularly
on suitable evenings, and sit or hop about on the damp grass or
flower-borders.&nbsp; And they exhibited a most special tendency
(as has been observed by others) to come down to the house as if
desiring an entrance.&nbsp; Indeed, when the door was open they
would not unfrequently walk in.&nbsp; And I have more than once
found one of them in my study or other room, sitting up in a
corner, looking happy and comfortable, and <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>quietly
staring at me with its bright eyes, as if I were the real
intruder.</p>
<p>The direction of my rooms from the garden is from south to
north.&nbsp; I do not know if this was possibly expressive of any
migratory instinct.</p>
<p>Like the Frogs, of a number of Toads which I introduced into
my garden, only three or four remained in the following year; and
soon all disappeared, except one, whose end was peculiar and of
dramatic interest.&nbsp; It occurred in this way: A neighbour
kept in his adjacent garden some other reptiles, namely, some
non-poisonous snakes.&nbsp; One of these seems to have escaped
from its cage and got over the dividing wall into my garden, and
on one summer morning was discovered by me on my grass-plot, with
this Toad (about a half-grown one) in his mouth, which he was
trying to kill or swallow.&nbsp; I suppose the Toad was too large
or too lively, for the snake was making very serious exertions,
and was actively agitating its body in a linear direction.&nbsp;
When seen at a distance, it looked like a stout piece of cord or
fine rope agitated by the wind, with a movement like that of a
carpet when it is flapped and shaken.&nbsp; The Toad had been
seized by the hinder part of its back, as shown by the two
bleeding punctures afterwards found.</p>
<p>When the snake saw me advancing towards it, it rapidly
wriggled or undulated away towards the ivy-covered wall, where it
was lost.&nbsp; But it retained its hold of the Toad almost to
the last, and until I had got quite close up to it.</p>
<p>This incident is not only interesting, but it also shows that
these reptiles must have some instinctive power of knowing of the
neighbourhood of comparatively distant prey; for the rockery
stones from which it was taken <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>must have been at least thirty to
forty yards from its own domicile.&nbsp; Such an instinct would
seem to be the equivalent of that well known to be possessed by
birds of prey.&nbsp; I regret that this poor Toad did not long
survive his fright and bad usage.</p>
<p>My Toads have exhibited the usual tendency of these animals to
hide away beneath stones or earth, and in unfrequented
corners.&nbsp; When discovered it is curious to watch their
half-frightened expression, and their peculiar mode of breathing
by their under jaw, which appears at once to increase in
rapidity.&nbsp; They do not resist much when handled, but it is
curious to note how they continue to swell their sides out, until
they produce a very prominent rotundity of their body.&nbsp;
After the episode of the Snake and my Toad, the idea suggests
itself that this is intended to make themselves as large as
possible, not from envy of the Ox, as stated in the fable with
reference to the Frog, but to make themselves too large a morsel
to be swallowed by the lesser of those animals which prey upon
them.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;Toads in holes&rdquo; would come out from their
retreat in dry weather, a few hours <i>before</i> rain, after
which they would again disappear, often for a long season.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Insects</span>.&mdash;There are plenty of
these in every garden, however small; and Bees, Flies, Beetles,
and especially Spiders, would afford a never ending source of
interest.&nbsp; The only insects which I have specially watched
are <span class="smcap">Ants</span>, nests and colonies of which
appear and reappear every summer upon my garden paths, or upon
the adjacent portions of the grass-plots.</p>
<p>We all know of the very numerous observers of and writers upon
these little creatures; and their works, from Huber down to Sir
John Lubbock, will be more <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>or less familiar to us all.&nbsp;
Their industry, their building powers, their gregarious nature,
their division of labour, their apparent working for the common
good, their devotion to the young, their colonizing instincts, as
well as some of the changes which their insect forms undergo, are
all there recorded.</p>
<p>And many of these things are easily to be observed by anyone
who takes the trouble.</p>
<p>I can only venture here to make one or two brief notes on
their proceedings in St. Giles&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>Both the small brown and the small black Ants are to be here
seen, but they occupy different positions; and not only do not
seem to be on neighbourly terms with each other, but fight at
once if experimentally placed together.</p>
<p>The brown Ants are the more numerous, and in the summer months
display an enormous amount of activity.&nbsp; Doubtless there is
a good reason for their incessant movements, but to the ordinary
observer these often seem to be purposeless and merely the result
of restlessness and excess of energy.</p>
<p>The favourite situation for their little Ant-hills is
decidedly along the edge of the gravel path, where this abuts
upon the grass sward, and it is noticeable that almost the whole
of these are placed on the easterly edge of this.&nbsp; From
these nests, or centres, very little use is made of the adjacent
grass territory, but from nearly all a track is made across the
gravel path to its opposite (westerly) side, where either a hole
is made into a small fresh home, or a semi-tunnel is made through
the grass edging on to and into the earth of the flower-border
beyond.&nbsp; There appears to be no attempt to tunnel in the
firm gravel path, but the incessant racing backward and forward
in the same <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>line very soon (as Sir John Lubbock, now Lord Avebury,
has pointed out) makes a well-trodden road, along which they
follow each other in rapid succession.</p>
<p>As to their hour of rising in the morning for work, I cannot
speak from personal observation.&nbsp; But as Solomon holds them
out as an example to those inclined unduly to keep their beds, I
conclude that their motto is, &ldquo;Early to rise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But I can say that the opposite half of this proverb, namely,
&ldquo;Early to bed,&rdquo; does not apply to them, for, at least
in the warm weather, they do certainly often work until late at
night.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to watch these Ants at work, and to
note their activity and energy and strength.&nbsp; An Ant is
&ldquo;but a little creature,&rdquo; but he is certainly able to
perform a large amount of physical work.&nbsp; And especially is
this seen in the way he builds up those little heaps of earth
known as Ant-hills.&nbsp; I have had many of these under
observation, and the rapidity with which they reappear after
injury by pressure or a heavy rain-storm is very
remarkable.&nbsp; Twenty-four hours, or even less, being often
sufficient for their complete restoration.&nbsp; They are of
varying form, but some are perfectly conical, with a circular
hole at the top exactly like that of some Norfolk
&ldquo;kilns&rdquo; used for the burning of bricks.&nbsp; Others
are irregular, or flattened and spongy, with several holes.&nbsp;
But it would seem that the varying shapes are largely due to the
special conditions under which they are made.</p>
<p class="gutindent">* 1907.&nbsp; I have noted that this year
the brown Ants have varied in colour, or have been replaced in
their more usual spots on my gravel walk by others that are
nearly if not quite black.&nbsp; And I have also noticed that
their habits are somewhat different.&nbsp; The little conical
Ant-hills which they make are much smaller, but more numerous,
than those of their predecessors, and they seem to burrow more in
the <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>adjacent grass lawn.&nbsp; But they keep to almost the
same spots.&nbsp; In their daily workings and activities also
there is a decided difference.&nbsp; They are very active in the
early mornings, but often can scarcely be seen all the mid-day or
afternoon, instead of racing about above ground almost the whole
day, as the others did.&nbsp; But they may have been influenced
in this by the continued cool and showery weather of the
season.</p>
<p>One very warm day about noon, in the early part of September,
I witnessed some of the proceedings at one of the well-known
&ldquo;wedding ceremonials&rdquo; of Ants.&nbsp; The whole body
of the Ants were swarming on the grass above the nest, and racing
about in evidently a great state of excitement.&nbsp; Amongst
these were five large winged (Queen) Ants, constantly moving
about, though more quietly, and in and out of the nest
opening.&nbsp; Also in the group were some forty or more smaller
winged (Male) Ants, also moving about upon the ground.&nbsp; None
of the winged Ants were flying far about.&nbsp; I watched this
state of commotion for some time, then left, and returned in
about an hour, when the whole body of these insects had
disappeared, presumably into the nest.&nbsp; Whether the brides
and bridegrooms were about to take their wedding flight, or
whether (as appears most probable) they had just returned, I am
unable to state; but I saw no further commotion outside later on
in the day.</p>
<p>I have often watched these little creatures at work upon their
&ldquo;heaps,&rdquo; and have noted how these are gradually built
up of aggregations of single grains of earth or sand, which
evidently have been dug out grain by grain from the earth, where
the excavation is going on, and are then brought in the
Ant&rsquo;s mouth to the surface, and to the top of the rising
earth-heap.&nbsp; They are then dropped over its edge, and the
Carrier Ant at once races back into the hole presumably for a
fresh burden.&nbsp; This process is a very remarkable one, and
the way the Ant brings his grain of earth in his mouth and drops
it over the edge of the rising Ant-hill, irresistibly reminds one
of a railway navvy who wheels his barrow full of earth and tilts
it over the edge of the embankment upon which he is at
work.&nbsp; The number of single grains in even a small Ant-heap
must be very large, and must amount to many <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>thousands, or
perhaps to hundreds of thousands.&nbsp; What, then, must be the
untiring energy of a small Ant colony, which can reproduce such a
granular heap in less than twenty-four hours?</p>
<p>It does not always seem clear what the streams of Ants from
the parent nest are so constantly occupied in.&nbsp; They may be,
to a certain extent, colonizers, but they certainly do not, with
me, raise secondary Ant-hills to any great extent at the end of
their runs.&nbsp; They make holes in the ground there, and
possibly they may be engaged in their proverbial custom of
securing and storing up food for the winter.&nbsp; To the
uninstructed eye these holes look very much like Colonial
outposts.</p>
<p>The activity of these Ants entirely ceases with the advent of
autumn, and their Ant-hills in my garden entirely disappear until
the following season.</p>
<p>As we all know, this instinct of storing up food for winter
use has been largely denied, but from Sir John Lubbock&rsquo;s
account it certainly exists in some species, though its extent
varies greatly.&nbsp; As he says that many of the Ants live
through the winter, some food would seem to be required.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ants generically, we all doubtless accept King
Solomon&rsquo;s authority upon this point, and we shall not
forget that the Roman poet, Virgil, writing just before the
Christian era, expressed himself to the same effect.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ac veluti ingentem formic&aelig; farris
acervum<br />
Cum populant, hyemis memores, tectoque reponunt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst Cicero says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In formica non modo sensus, sed etiam mens,
ratio, memoria.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Lastly,
did time and inclination permit, I might have found endless
interest in observing the habits of the vast quantities of <span
class="smcap">Worms</span> (again with the aid of Sir John
Lubbock) which inhabit my grass-plot; or those of the <span
class="smcap">Snails</span>; or of the <span
class="smcap">Slugs</span>, which exist in equally innumerable
quantities in the garden soil.&nbsp; Both these latter classes of
animals appear to be made to be eaten, as they largely furnish
food for the birds.&nbsp; They prefer damp or wet weather, and to
some degree are excellent weather-glasses or weather
prophets.&nbsp; As we all know, they roam or sail about on rainy
evenings.&nbsp; But it is curious to observe also the special
instinct by which in dry periods the Snails will become aware of
watered or damp earth at a considerable distance, and how they
will in the night cross a large breadth of dry, or even dusty
earth, to reach a spot of ground where plants have been watered
on the previous evening.&nbsp; I need scarcely remind you that
these land mollusks, the Snails, and still more the Slugs, are
creatures with super-excellent appetites for the garden
plants.</p>
<p>I have now, in conclusion, not only to apologize to this
Society for the length of my paper, but, perhaps, also for having
brought it before you at all.</p>
<p>I did not venture to do so until I had asked our excellent and
experienced Secretary whether he considered that a few such
popular or surface notes, even if containing little that is new,
would be acceptable, or even appropriate, to such a learned
body.&nbsp; My real object has been less to state what I have
personally observed than to show what a large field still exists
in our city centres (as indeed everywhere) for a naturalistic use
of whatever out-door opportunities are present; and to illustrate
the principle that even in the <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>smallest and least promising city
gardens or spaces, the materials for interest and
self-instruction are ever present, and practically inexhaustible;
that here, as elsewhere, and everywhere, we may &ldquo;read, and
read again, and still find something new; something to please,
and something to instruct.&rdquo;</p>

PRESIDENT&rsquo;S ADDRESS. <a name="citation72"></a><a
href="#footnote72" class="citation">[72]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>&mdash;Another
of our Society&rsquo;s years has come to a close this day, and it
devolves upon me to say a few final words before yielding up this
presidential chair.&nbsp; In doing so, my chief desire is to
repeat my thanks to the members for having placed me in so
honourable a position, and for their kindness in sustaining me
throughout the various evening meetings of the session.</p>
<p>It is a matter of much congratulation that these meetings have
continued to be well attended, and that the Society itself has
continued thoroughly to fill that position of scientific
usefulness which was hoped for it at its first inauguration, now
eighteen years ago.&nbsp; Such a lapse of time gives the
opportunity of seeing how much good work has in the aggregate
been done.&nbsp; And though, no doubt, in looking back through
our volumes it will be found that different years have produced a
varying amount of work judged by its importance, yet on the
average we have reason to be well satisfied with what the
successive numbers show us, seeing that the total represents a
very <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>important collection indeed of natural history facts and
information.&nbsp; The work of the present year has, I think,
fully maintained the good average attained in other sessions.</p>
<p>The Society too, has, as a whole, continued to prosper, and
appears to be effectually carrying out the initial programme set
forth on the first page of each volume of its
&ldquo;Transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On looking back to some of our earliest annual reports, I find
that our numbers have doubled and trebled themselves since that
time; and further that the list now embraces the names of many
both at home and afar off, whose reputations are well known to
science, and who are powerful additions to our Society&rsquo;s
strength.&nbsp; As compared, too, with those earlier times, the
increased plumpness of our yearly volume tells of the greater
amount of matter that is now every year contributed.</p>
<p>So, too, if prosperous finance is any test of success, we may
look to the larger figures in our balance sheet, and the
sufficiently satisfactory state of our &ldquo;balance at the
bank&rdquo; further to fortify the favourable position which I
desire to point out to you.</p>
<p>We have had an accession of twenty-one new members during the
year, whilst seventeen have been removed by death, resignation,
or other causes.&nbsp; But though the total losses from these
causes have been but few, and those from death not above the
average, yet these latter include some well-known names&mdash;the
names of members of valued attainments, and of men whom the
Society could ill spare.</p>
<p>Especially do we note with regret the premature loss, in only
middle life, of one who had been a member of this Society from
its commencement, who was also a life member of the Zoological
Society, and whose death would <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>have claimed attention from us as
Norwich men, were it for no other reason than that he bore a name
the very sound of which is instinct with ideas of Norfolk Natural
History; one who was also a member of a family to which this
Society, and the neighbouring Museum, owe a long and
ever-increasing debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>Although the late Mr. John Gurney&rsquo;s talents were never,
I believe, especially directed to our class of study, yet his
tastes for the bright and the beautiful were well known.&nbsp;
And though his affliction had of late years debarred him from the
complete visual enjoyment of the beauties of nature, yet his
devotion to the improvement of the rural charms of his own home,
and his public-spirited expenditure upon the scheme for the
laying out of Mousehold Heath, and its appropriate development,
showed that he had in him that form of mind out of which the true
lover of nature&rsquo;s creatures, as well as nature&rsquo;s
charms, necessarily arises.</p>
<p>But this side of Mr. Gurney&rsquo;s mind will come home to us
as naturalists much more forcibly when we recall the great act of
his life, in which he was so heartily and so earnestly engaged
when death removed him so suddenly in the midst of his useful and
public-spirited career.&nbsp; I, of course, allude to his great
Castle-Museum scheme for the removal of our grand Museum
collection, with its surroundings, to a new and larger and more
appropriate position on the Castle Hill.&nbsp; We all know the
generous liberality with which he sought to ensure this grand
scheme being carried out.&nbsp; We have all noted the quiet and
business-like sagacity with which the various steps necessary for
the effective doing of this work were taken under his
inspiration.&nbsp; And I am sure we recognise how he was actuated
not only by a desire to raise the scientific <i>status</i> of the
county and city generally, but also to assist those <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Norfolk
workers in nature&rsquo;s fields whose accumulated results are
now to be seen under this roof.</p>
<p>His large and increasing views for the good of this city, and
its general welfare, have been so thoroughly and so publicly
appreciated on all sides, that it is not necessary for me to add
one word more.&nbsp; His name will remain as that of a public man
at once generous and right-minded.&nbsp; And I can only hope on
behalf of this Society, and that of other kindred ones, that
nothing will occur to prevent the full development and carrying
out of that Castle scheme, which, if effected, will, in my
opinion, have a large and important influence not only upon the
future scientific progress of Norfolk generally, but also upon
the intellectual position which our famous old city will hold in
the time to come.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampden G. Glasspoole, who has also recently died, had
been a member of this Society from its commencement, and had
contributed two papers to its proceedings.&nbsp; These were
entitled &ldquo;Biographical Memoirs of some Norwich
Botanists,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Memoir of Lilly Wigg.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had also published several papers in <i>Science
Gossip</i>.&nbsp; He was for several years a member of the late
Norwich Microscopical Society; and of the London Quekett
Club.</p>
<p>Mr. Glasspoole was an accomplished botanist.&nbsp; For many of
the later years of his residence at Ormesby, he was honorary
curator of Botany at the Norwich Museum; and after his removal to
London he held, for a short period, the office of botanist to the
Alexandra Palace.</p>
<p>He will be remembered by us all as kindly, gentle, and genial;
ever ready to help others with his time or his knowledge; and
with all his stores of information, modest and unassuming.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>He
added one species to the British Flora, <i>Carex trinervis</i>,
Devgl; and two species to our county list, namely, <i>Ammophila
Baltica</i>, Leak, and <i>Sparganium neglectum</i>, Beeby.</p>
<p>As is well known, he was the eldest son of the late Capt. R.
Glasspoole of Ormesby, who had himself presented many
<i>curios</i> to our Museum, and who published a most interesting
account of his experiences whilst a prisoner in the hands of
Chinese pirates.</p>
<p>The Ornithology of Scotland has, in the death of Mr. Robert
Gray, which took place at Edinburgh in February last, lost one of
its ablest exponents.&nbsp; Commencing with &ldquo;The Birds of
Ayrshire and Wigtonshire,&rdquo; which appeared in 1869, Mr.
Gray, two years later, published the more important &ldquo;Birds
of the West of Scotland,&rdquo; and at the time of his death was
engaged on a similar work treating of the birds of the Eastern
district of his native country.&nbsp; In this latter work he was,
I believe, associated with Mr. William Evans of Edinburgh, who,
it is to be hoped, will bring their joint labours to a successful
issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray commenced public life in the City of Glasgow Bank,
and it was whilst acting as Inspector of Agencies for that
establishment that he was enabled to collect the information
which so enriched his work on the &ldquo;Birds of the West of
Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp; Subsequently Mr. Gray entered the Bank of
Scotland, and at the time of his death occupied the position of
its chief cashier.&nbsp; Since his residence in Edinburgh, he has
taken a prominent position in the scientific institutions of that
city, and was a Vice-President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
and Secretary of the Royal Physical Society.&nbsp; He did not
become a member of our Society until 1884, but has been long
known by several of its members, and highly valued as a
correspondent or friend.</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>The
only other member of this Society whose death we have to deplore
is Captain Philip Hamond, who has for some time left this city,
but who will be well remembered as having resided for awhile at
Mousehold House, Thorpe.&nbsp; He showed much interest in the
natural history of Norfolk, and also in its antiquities; and he
left a valuable collection of books relating to Norfolk.</p>
<p>During the past session we have had many valued <i>papers</i>
contributed to our Society; besides some notes&mdash;shorter, but
not necessarily less interesting, or of less value.</p>
<p>We have also had several specimens exhibited.&nbsp; And, in
addition, we have had a considerable number of members who have
taken part in the various discussions.</p>
<p>I need scarcely remind you how varied these contributions have
been; and how birds, beasts, fishes, insects, and smaller
creatures; as well as seeds and plants, great and small; have all
received illustrations during the year.&nbsp; Distant parts of
the globe, too, have helped to supply us with the material which
has been brought before us, notably by our late President,
Colonel Feilden.</p>
<p>Many of the papers will be published in the forthcoming
&ldquo;Transactions&rdquo; of the Society; and to these I need
scarcely allude, as they can all be read by us very
shortly.&nbsp; But I should scarcely like to omit to mention the
beautiful botanical specimens exhibited by Mr. Long, of Wells, at
our last meeting.&nbsp; The rarity and interest of some of them,
the beauty and finish of the mountings, and the true scientific
intelligence displayed in all, can but make us desire that so
competent a collector would not only further explore his
district, but also enrich this Society by the exhibition of the
fruit of his researches.</p>
<p>As to the contributions which will not appear in our
&ldquo;Transactions&rdquo;:&mdash;At the May meeting, Mr. F.
Sutton read some interesting notes on Strawberry growing.&nbsp;
In October, <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>Mr. Southwell read extracts from the records of the
Whaling s.s. &ldquo;Eclipse&rdquo; in the Greenland seas.&nbsp;
Mr. Southwell&rsquo;s notes referred more particularly to the
natural history occurrences of the voyage; the birds and animals
met with.&nbsp; And he exhibited several forms of Whale and Seal
food, consisting of Crustacea and various minute organisms; as
well as the skulls of two Greenland Seals, two Ringed Seals, and
a Polar Bear, sent him by Mr. Robert Gray&mdash;all which latter
he has presented to the Norwich Museum.&nbsp; He also exhibited a
very rare little fish of the genus <i>Scopelus</i>, likewise
taken by Mr. Gray.</p>
<p>At the same meeting, our most valued and efficient member, Mr.
Geldart, read a paper on the <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i> or Rice
Food of Whales, from the West Coast of Spitzbergen, and
illustrated by it the natural law of gradation in feeding,
showing that whilst some Whales themselves eat this food, others
devour the Cod and Herring, which eat these little crustaceans,
which again eat the diatoms, found floating in such enormous
numbers on the surface of those seas.</p>
<p>My own humble contribution to the proceedings of our last
meeting, in the shape of a paper on the habits of some of our
town birds, entitled &ldquo;My Christmas Garden Party,&rdquo; has
been recently published in <i>extenso</i>, and therefore need not
be further alluded to here.</p>
<p>There has been only one <i>Excursion</i> made during the year,
but this appears to have been full of interest and
enjoyment.&nbsp; I have received a lively and detailed account of
the day&rsquo;s proceedings from Mr. Bussey, but I regret that
time only permits me to note the principal features of the
occasion.</p>
<p>The visit was made to the Salhouse and Wroxham Broads, and the
neighbouring district, including the Broomhills, St.
Benedict&rsquo;s Abbey, and portions of the <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>river
Bure.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to say how ample is the material in
this district for the study of both the animal and vegetable
kingdom; and as the day was fine, the opportunities afforded were
fully availed of.&nbsp; As usual, this occasion for field study
fully repaid those who took part in it, for their devotion of the
day to this pleasant combination of research and recreation.</p>
<p>The field over which &ldquo;Natural History&rdquo; extends is
a very wide one, and properly includes the study of all organised
beings, living and dead.&nbsp; At one end the ground is, to a
very considerable extent, occupied by the Geological Society,
which exists in Norwich; yet even in this department we have had,
as I have said, some very valuable contributions during the
year.&nbsp; But at the other end, which embraces the study of
minute or microscopic life, not only have we had no contributions
during the past session, but I find, on looking over the past
numbers of our &ldquo;Transactions,&rdquo; that the papers
dealing with this part of the world&rsquo;s life have been both
few and far between.&nbsp; There have been, as we know, some
great and valuable exceptions, such as the papers read by Mr.
Kitton, the address by Mr. Plowright, a portion of the address
read by the President, Mr. Sutton, two years ago, and, perhaps,
one or two others.&nbsp; Still the small part which microscopical
records and observations play in our annals is both noticeable
and regrettable&mdash;the more so, because in consequence of the
decease of the old Norwich Microscopical Society, I believe that
no public or systematic work in this direction is now being
carried on in this city.&nbsp; And yet, partly in consequence of
the larger forms of life having now been so largely studied, but
still more in consequence of the new views as to the universality
and far-reaching importance of microscopic living
beings&mdash;there is probably no phase of natural history which
is now more engaging general <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>attention, or which is being more
eagerly studied and investigated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Mr. Sutton, in his presidential address of 1884&ndash;85, gave
a most learned and interesting description of some of the
microscopical researches which had been carried on up to that
time, and further gave us a most lucid account of the influence
which micro-organisms had been shown to exert in the process of
nitrification in soils, an influence which had formerly been
considered to be due to purely chemical action. <a
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a></p>
<p>I trust I may be forgiven if I recall your attention for a few
moments to this subject of Germ life, more particularly as it
branches out and develops in a more vital direction; in other
words as it affects human and animal life.</p>
<p>This portion of the subject has, during the past two or three
years, deepened and strengthened in interest; our knowledge of it
has largely increased; and the recognition of its vital
importance has called forth, both in Europe and America, a host
of eager and capable workers.&nbsp; It is scarcely too much to
say that its wide and far-reaching issues are probably the most
important to mankind of any that have been studied in recent
times.&nbsp; Foremost amongst the workers in this department may
be recalled to you the well-known names of Koch and Pasteur,
abroad; and of Lister, Watson-Cheyne, and Crookshank, in this
country.&nbsp; But the names of other eminent investigators will
almost necessarily occur to your minds.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>It has
long been known what potent factors were microscopic Germs in
producing changes in the constitution of decaying matter; and how
they were, in all probability, the useful scavengers of nature,
definitely resolving into their constituent elements failing and
dying organic tissues.&nbsp; But it has become more and more a
matter of knowledge, that by their parasitic habits and their
power of invading and living upon and within other living
tissues, they are also the sources of many so-called diseases of
both vegetables and animals.</p>
<p>With regard to vegetable parasitic growth I will not now
detain you.&nbsp; The blights, and the mildews, and the ergots,
as well as minuter forms, such as alg&aelig; and micrococci, are
well known; and no doubt much more is still to be learned from
their further investigation; whilst by analogy it seems highly
probable that the circulating fluids of higher members of the
vegetable kingdom may be found to be invaded by parasitic beings
in the same way as their animal compeers.</p>
<p>But it is to Germ life in animal bodies that I wish now
specially to allude.&nbsp; I have said that our knowledge in this
direction has, even in the last two or three years, made enormous
strides, and it is now almost a matter of certainty that all
contagious or infectious disorders, as well as many others, are
but the expression of the fact that minute living bodies have
made a resting-place for themselves in or upon other living
tissues; and that the development of the phenomena of these
morbid states is but an indication of their presence and
reproductive activity&mdash;either as cause, or as an
accompaniment of these disease manifestations.&nbsp; And this
applies not only to the human species, but to lower classes of
animals, between whom and man many of these diseases are
interchangeable.</p>
<p>Such knowledge necessarily invests the life history of <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>these minute
Germs with intense interest, seeing that it is probably one step,
and that a long one, towards the discovery of the means of
prevention, if not also of cure, of many of our most fatal and
dreaded diseases.</p>
<p>Examples of such diseases are:&mdash;Scarlet Fever,
Diphtheria, Small Pox, Cholera, Yellow Fever, Tuberculous
Disease, Ague, Hydrophobia, Cattle Plague, Anthrax; and many
others might be enumerated whose dependence upon parasitic Germs
is almost conclusively proved.&nbsp; But these are sufficient to
show the deep interest of this branch of study.</p>
<p>Not only are these Germs found in the solids of the body in
some of these diseases, but in others their presence is easily
and constantly recognisable in the blood or other fluids, and
even within the corpuscles which the blood so largely
contains.&nbsp; And not only so, but the forms which these
micro-organisms present are so constant and so definite in the
different disorders, that it is now almost possible in some
instances to diagnose what diseased condition we have to deal
with by an examination of the fluid or tissue in which they are
contained.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, but right here to say that some of our most
cautious observers consider that it is as yet hardly
<i>proven</i> that the differing Germs found in the various
diseases are their actual and efficient cause; but their
definiteness in the various disorders, and the constancy of their
presence, leave little doubt that this will hereafter be
conclusively shown to be the case.</p>
<p>Some of these Germs seem to have a short life and rapid
development, and then we have acute disease.&nbsp; Others seem to
have a more prolonged or continuing career, and then we have
chronic disease.&nbsp; Whilst others seem to have an intermitting
development, and then we have paroxysmal disease.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Many
curious facts have been observed in reference to the forms, or
multiplication, or life-history of some of these parasitic
beings.&nbsp; Thus, for example, in one class (<i>Filaria
sanguinis</i>) it was noticed that the minute embryos of this
little blood-worm could only be discovered in the evening or
during the night, and not during the day; and the reason of this
has appeared to be that it is necessary that they should come
within reach of the Mosquito Gnat, which is a night-feeding
animal, in whose bodies one stage of their development appears to
take place.</p>
<p>One of the latest discoveries in this department of natural
history is that of the blood germs, which co-exist with the
various forms of ague and malarious disease, and upon which they
would appear to depend.&nbsp; Dr. Osler, of Pennsylvania (now
Regius Professor of Medicine, at Oxford), has recently described
and figured these little bodies in an elaborate paper full of
interest.</p>
<p>Such facts as these, when regarded merely from the point of
view of a member of the Medical Profession have their deep and
<i>special</i> significance.&nbsp; But I am here to-night as a
member of the Naturalists&rsquo; Society, and by all of us, in
that capacity, they are first to be regarded, not as
illustrations of disease, but of the life history of some of
nature&rsquo;s creations&mdash;creations which are no doubt as
important, as definite, and which play as large a part in the
general scheme of life, as do many of the larger forms of
animated beings.</p>
<p>Some of these little bodies, especially those of the bacillary
and bacterial class, are extremely minute, and are best examined
with powers ranging from one-tenth to one-twenty-fifth of an
inch; and it is impossible to ignore the fact that their study
requires not only good instruments, but much patience and skilled
attention.&nbsp; Nevertheless, such study fairly comes within the
scope <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of
this Society&rsquo;s work, and will most certainly repay any of
its members who may be induced adequately to undertake it.</p>
<p>Nor let it be said that minuteness is any reason for lack of
interest on the part of the naturalist.&nbsp; For many of these
micro-organisms have already been shown to be as varied, and to
have as definite a structure, and as special a life history, as
any of the larger types of beings; whilst, of course, we all
recognise that apparent size is as nothing, that it is a mere
accident, a question of the construction of our enquiring eyes, a
condition that is at once altered and rectified by a magnifying
glass.</p>
<p>If it be true that the invasion and presence of various small
organisms in the blood or tissues is the cause of the various
specific diseases to which I have alluded, then the application
of such knowledge as naturalists can obtain, as to the food and
other conditions necessary to their existence; their mode of
ingress to the body; their development and multiplication,
becomes clear and obvious.&nbsp; It opens up to our minds
possibilities both of prevention, and of either mitigation or
cure.&nbsp; For it is evident that if we can starve these Germs
of their necessary nutriment, or make their new habitation
unsuitable for their healthy and vigorous development, their
career as invaders will necessarily either be cut short, or be
rendered feeble and impotent; and therefore the disease-changes
which they can produce less violent and less lethal.</p>
<p>Something of this kind appears naturally to have taken place
in those persons in whom some of the zymotic diseases (of which
Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, etc., may be taken as
familiar types) have once run their course; in those, that is,
who are popularly said to have already had these diseases.&nbsp;
And although the <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>exact abiding change which is produced has not been
ascertained, yet it is well known, and quite understood, to be
one which renders the fluids or tissues partially or wholly
unsuitable for their future healthy growth.</p>
<p>This theory, too, is the well-known explanation of the
protective power of the Cow Pox, which once having permeated a
human system, has rendered it unsuitable for the future healthy
and vigorous development of its greater relation&mdash;the Small
Pox.</p>
<p>In default of available means of destroying the Germs of other
malignant diseases, prolonged efforts have been made (and notably
by the great French pathologist, Pasteur) so to diminish the
intensity of the destructive force of some of these specific
Germs, that they may be safely inoculated into human bodies
without danger to life, and yet be potent enough in their effects
to anticipate and render abortive the invasion of the more
virulent diseases.&nbsp; This has been attempted by repeated
cultivations of the Germs in proper media, until after several of
such generations the broods shall have acquired the requisite
diminished vitality&mdash;in fact, until that diminution of
virulence which the Small Pox Germ has sustained in passing
through the Cow has been obtained by these artificial means.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the attempts which have recently been
made by Pasteur in this direction, in regard to that most fatal
disease Hydrophobia.&nbsp; It remains to be seen how far he has
been successful in solving this preventive problem; and how far
this may be the true method by which to utilize our knowledge of
bacterial life.&nbsp; Medical men are diligently working at this
subject from their own point of view.&nbsp; There is much to be
done by microscopic naturalists in unravelling the life-history
of these little beings; and we are glad to <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>recognise the
kind of results which may be hoped for in the future.</p>
<p>Such considerations as these are fraught with matter for deep
reflection, and tend to open our minds to the far-reaching
possibilities not only of this special knowledge, but of that
which we are gaining in many other branches of science.&nbsp;
Each fresh item of knowledge is like a new step upon a ladder,
and raises us to a fresh height from which we can take a wider
survey, and which we can assume as a loftier and broader basis
for further enquiry.&nbsp; Scientific thought is ever as to what
may next be done, and how to do it.&nbsp; For, as Sir James Paget
has recently said: &ldquo;Every increase of knowledge brings
before us a larger and clearer view of the immeasurable quantity
which is still to be gained.&nbsp; The more we know, the more can
we see, if we will, how much more there is that we do not
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; And of this we may be sure, that it is by
minute and exact work only that in the future our store of
knowledge is to be increased and made sure.&nbsp; If no other
example to prove this were at hand, it would be sufficient to
quote the recent observations of the Rev. Dr. Dallinger on the
subject of the conjugation of the nuclei of some minute forms of
cell life: observations which bring us nearer to some definite
knowledge of this particular matter than any hitherto made upon
higher classes of creatures.</p>
<p>Dr. Dallinger has spoken of the &ldquo;vast area of activity
and research in this direction;&rdquo; and Professor Huxley has
said, &ldquo;that those who have toiled for the advancement of
science are in a fair way of being overwhelmed by the realisation
of their wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We appear indeed to be still only on the threshold of
knowledge, to have merely touched the fringe of the vast and
infinite life-history which the living world, that <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>inexhaustible
stream of life which we see everywhere around us, contains.&nbsp;
We are proud of the amount of our natural history
knowledge.&nbsp; We think to have accumulated a large store of
information as to that especially of our own district.&nbsp; We
can point to the lists of animals and plants which the research
of the members of our Society, and others, has so laboriously
gathered together.&nbsp; And we can look to the stores of our
Museum as illustrations of what has been done.&nbsp; And yet a
little further consideration at once shows us how small a part
this is of what is yet to be known.&nbsp; We know the gross form
of the specimens; we know something of their habits during life;
and yet how little is this of what there is to be known about
them.&nbsp; Who is there of the most learned who can properly
explain the meaning of one hundredth part of what these creatures
present in form, size, colour, and intimate structure?&nbsp; We
have a general idea that their special peculiarities have
relation to the two primary essentials of life&mdash;the daily
bread, and the perpetuation of the species&mdash;but we are
largely unable to explain the <i>raison d&rsquo;etre</i> of many
of the commonest facts which they present.&nbsp; It will be a
great day when we can also explain the object or utility of all
the variations which they present.</p>
<p>Of course I do not forget the powerful impulse given by the
researches of Darwin in the direction of explaining the why and
the wherefore.&nbsp; I only indicate how large a portion of this
explanatory field is yet untilled.</p>
<p>In this county a Naturalists&rsquo; Society will never lack
either for material to work on, or for variety and interest of
subject.&nbsp; Much, even in its grosser form, still remains to
be learned.&nbsp; And the vast variety presented by the county,
in respect of climate, soils, strata, heath, woodland, marsh,
stagnant and running water, as well as the proximity <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>of the great
ocean with its shore&mdash;presents an almost unexampled field
for the work of the scientific naturalist&mdash;a field, too,
which is constantly changing in accordance with the physical and
other changes steadily going on in the district.</p>
<p>With these great natural advantages, and with the great love
for natural science, which is inherent in Norfolk men, I make
bold to hope and prognosticate for this Society a prolonged and
continuously useful career.&nbsp; We are glad to see its library
growing, and its journalistic interchanges increasing.&nbsp; We
are glad of the increasing importance of the position which it
holds amongst kindred societies.&nbsp; We are all, I am sure,
looking forward to the time when this, our Society, will meet in
a handsome airy room on the top of the Castle Hill; <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a> when any student of any particular
branch of this natural history will be able (on repairing to our
Museum) to see not merely inaccessible specimens ranged three or
four deep, but so displayed as to be available for study and
examination; when lectures and demonstrations will be possible,
because there will be sufficient room space to contain both the
lecturer and his audience; in short, when we in Norwich shall
have a scientific centre worthy of the Museum and of the great
reputation which this district has always held.</p>
<p>What a happy change, too, when the old Castle of
Norwich&mdash;the last of our three city prisons&mdash;shall
exchange its human prisoners for forms, imprisoned indeed, but
not human; and intended only to enlarge and instruct and make
more free the mind of man.&nbsp; And when Science and Art and the
cultivation of the intelligence shall tend year by year, and ever
more and more, to render real <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>prisons less and less required.&nbsp;
And when the moral sense and the force of cultivated public
opinion shall suffice to reduce crime and ill-doing to its
minimum.&nbsp; We gladly recognise how much has already been
done, and we look forward with hope in both these directions to
the good time coming.</p>
<p>In now resigning this chair to my learned and distinguished
successor, I can only trust that he will find his year of office
as pleasant, and as profitable to himself, as the Members of this
Society, and their excellent Secretary, have rendered mine to
me.</p>

THE PARISH OF ST. GILES&rsquo;S, NORWICH, AND ITS CHURCH. <a
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a></h2>
<p>The parish of St. Giles&rsquo;s, though relatively not large,
yet has always in later periods occupied an important position in
the City of Norwich.&nbsp; It formerly&mdash;as is usual with
parishes dedicated to Saint Giles&mdash;lay upon the outskirts of
the city, though not <i>necessarily</i> within the city proper
previously to 1253 <a name="citation90b"></a><a
href="#footnote90b" class="citation">[90b]</a> (as Mr. Hudson has
pointed out), when the city was enclosed with a fosse.&nbsp; In
recent times Norwich has expanded largely in the direction of
Earlham and Heigham, and St. Giles&rsquo;s is now completely
overlapped by these populous suburbs.</p>
<p>Blomefield describes the parish as having been part of a new
portion of Norwich called the New Burgh, originally settled in
the time of Edward the Confessor, but much increased at the
Conquest by the Normans or Frenchmen settling in it.&nbsp; He
says they chose and took this position as being the pleasantest
part of the city; but it may also have been that they selected it
as being merely the best ground as yet unoccupied by earlier
settlers.</p>
<p>St. Giles&rsquo;s parish is broadly triangular in form, with
its base along Chapel Field Road and St. Giles&rsquo;s
Hill.&nbsp; It <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>covers (according to Ordnance Survey) a space of
22&middot;952 acres, and comprises within its area rather more
than half of Chapel Field.&nbsp; Its western boundary is along
the site of the old city wall, and of St. Giles&rsquo;s Gate,
whilst on the eastern or city side it extends as far as
Fisher&rsquo;s Lane and a little beyond.&nbsp; The population in
1881 was 1,438.</p>
<p>A main city street runs through it, now known as St.
Giles&rsquo;s Street, but formerly called Inferior Newport,
Nether Newport, or Lower Newport; Bethel Street being then called
Over or Upper Newport.</p>
<p>This street is handsome and well-built, and contains several
large and important houses or mansions.&nbsp; Of late years
several of these have been converted into the homes of public
institutions, and the &ldquo;Young Men&rsquo;s Christian
Association,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gilman&rsquo;s Insurance
Offices,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Masonic Association,&rdquo; now
occupy some of the largest of them.</p>
<p>On the north side of this main street, near to Fisher&rsquo;s
Lane, formerly stood a <i>Domus Dei</i>, or Almshouse, but this
was pulled down about 150 years ago.&nbsp; Browne, writing in
1814, says: &ldquo;On the south side of this street is the office
of Mack&rsquo;s London Waggons, which go and return to and from
London every week.&rdquo;&nbsp; These waggons continued to ply
for many years; and &ldquo;Mack&rsquo;s yard,&rdquo; which
adjoined what is now Mortimer&rsquo;s Hotel, was a business
centre of considerable importance.</p>
<p>In olden times, <i>Fisher&rsquo;s Lane</i>, which extends from
St. Giles&rsquo;s Broad Street to Pottergate Street, was believed
to have been so called as being the road to a fish-quay, which
formerly existed there; but this is now thought to be very
doubtful.&nbsp; The other principal thoroughfares are <i>St.
Giles&rsquo;s Plain</i>, in which was formerly an open
pit&mdash;seen and mentioned by Kirkpatrick, but long since
filled up; <i>Rigby&rsquo;s Court</i>, leading from it, formerly
called <i>Pit Lane</i>, <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>but now known as Rigby&rsquo;s Court,
from the eminent Dr. Rigby, who once lived at its St.
Giles&rsquo;s end; and <i>Willow Lane</i>, noteworthy for having
for a time been the residence of the Rev. Francis Blomefield, the
Norfolk historian, and of George Henry Borrow, the celebrated
writer.</p>
<p>The principal <span class="smcap">Public Buildings</span>
are</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>The Church</i>,</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>The Church Schools</i>, built in
1862,</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>The Roman Catholic Chapel</i>, erected in
1828, and</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>The Volunteer Drill Hall</i>, erected in
1865&ndash;6.</p>
<p>Until quite recently the City Prison stood immediately outside
the Gate of St. Giles; but the site of this prison is now
occupied by the Roman Catholic Church, now in process of
erection.</p>
<p>In earlier times a <i>Leper-house</i> existed just beyond the
gate.</p>
<p>Also until recently there existed just beyond the gate a
series of remarkable and ancient <i>chalk vaults</i>, or
excavations.&nbsp; They are described by Mr. Woodward
(&ldquo;Arch&aelig;ologia&rdquo; vol. xxiij., p. 411), who showed
a plan of them made by John Bond in 1571.&nbsp; Woodward thinks
they were galleries made to obtain the chalk flints for building
purposes, whilst Mr. Rye says &ldquo;they were probably worked by
the masons of the Castle and Cathedral for the sake of the
chalk.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are now filled up.</p>
<p><i>The City Wall</i>, built between 1294 and 1319, surrounded
the outer and western margin of this parish; and St.
Giles&rsquo;s Gateway, the &ldquo;Porte de Newport,&rdquo; or
Gate of Newport, stood at the western end of St. Giles&rsquo;s
Street.&nbsp; Over this gate, at one time, lived an hermit.&nbsp;
It was pulled down in 1792.&nbsp; In 1867 the greater portion of
this part of the City Wall was also taken down; only a small
portion near the southern end of Chapel Field, <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>with one of
the towers, being left standing.&nbsp; A photograph of this
remnant is given in my book on St. Giles&rsquo;s parish; as well
as views of the Gateway as it existed in 1720 and 1792.&nbsp; The
latter were sketched by the Ninhams, and published by Mr. Fitch
in his work on the Gates of Norwich.</p>
<p><i>Chapel Field</i>, whose history is so strongly interwoven
with that of Norwich, lies on the southern side of St.
Giles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It takes its name from a Chapel of St. Mary,
which formerly stood where now is the building used as a High
School for Girls.&nbsp; More than half of it lies in this parish
(4&middot;790 acres out of a total of 8&middot;994 acres).&nbsp;
It was formerly known as Chapel Field Croft; and its ancient
owners are stated by Blomefield to have been the Prior of
Buckenham, the Prioress of Carhowe, and the Dean and College of
the Chapel in the Fields.&nbsp; But it appears to have been
acquired by the City during the sixteenth century, after the
dissolution of the monasteries.&nbsp; Chapel Field was at one
time a sort of <i>Campus Martius</i> of the city, and was used
for the musters and training of the local trained bands, as well
as for military reviews.&nbsp; After its acquirement by the
Corporation, the Field was for a long time usually let out on
lease.</p>
<p>In 1707 it was first railed in.&nbsp; In 1746 its main avenues
of trees were planted by Sir Thomas Churchman.&nbsp; In 1792 a
large portion of it was used for the construction of the
reservoir of the old Norwich Waterworks.&nbsp; In later times it
has been used for the drilling of Militia or Volunteers; as well
as for Volunteer reviews; also for the holding of f&ecirc;tes,
flower shows, bicycle meetings, and horse shows.&nbsp; The
well-remembered Fisheries Exhibition was held in the Drill Hall
in 1881.</p>
<p>In 1866 the Prince and Princess of Wales each planted a
Wellingtonia tree in the Field, but these did not flourish, <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>and have been
removed.&nbsp; In the same year the Field was enclosed with its
present handsome iron palisading, and it has since then been
transformed into the delightful Chapel Field Gardens, as we now
see them, with their special beauties, and the handsome iron
Pavilion in their midst.</p>
<p><i>The Church</i> of St. Giles, dedicated to the Saint of that
name, stands on the north side of Upper St. Giles&rsquo;s Street;
and is a striking object as we pass up the street, as well as
from many other points of view.&nbsp; It occupies a commanding
position, overlooking much of the surrounding district, and was
anciently called St. Giles&rsquo;s on the Hill.</p>
<p>Blomefield says it was founded by Elwyn the priest, and given
by him to the Monks of Norwich, after he had procured an
indulgence of twenty days&rsquo; pardon for all who should come
and offer here on St. Giles&rsquo;s Day, or within seven days
after, and it was rebuilt in the time of Richard II.&nbsp; The
chancel, which appears to have been a very long one, was
demolished in 1581, and was not rebuilt until the general
restoration of the Church in 1866, when it was restored mainly at
the cost of the Rev. W. N. Ripley (now Canon Ripley) who was then
Incumbent.</p>
<p>The Church is a fine perpendicular flint-work structure.&nbsp;
The tower is large and well proportioned.&nbsp; It is
battlemented and crowned with a small bell-cot and
weather-cock.&nbsp; It is rather more than 113 feet high, and the
hill upon which it stands is 85&middot;8 feet above the level of
the sea.&nbsp; From its height and conspicuous position, it was
selected in 1549 for placing a cresset, for a fire beacon, upon
its top.&nbsp; There was formerly a Cross and Image of the
Trinity in a niche on the west side of the steeple
(Blomefield).&nbsp; It has a clock on its eastern face, and
contains eight bells, one of which is rung as a Curfew every
evening <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>at
eight o&rsquo;clock, as has been the case for more than four
hundred years, in accordance with a benefaction of one John
Colton, in 1457.</p>
<p><i>The Belfry Chamber</i> contains five large steeple-boards,
with many names of ringers.</p>
<p><i>The Porch</i> has a fine groined vault, with fan tracery,
and a rich parapet and cornice.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick (1712) says of it: &ldquo;There is a neat porch of
freestone on the south side of the Church for entrance, with a
chamber above it.&nbsp; On each side of the window, which is in
the front, is a niche (with) spired top.&nbsp; On each side of
the arch of the door, cut in stone, is a cherub with an escocheon
before him.&nbsp; That on the east side has two pastoral
staffs.&nbsp; On the (west) a Pall, and at the top of the porch a
border of carved work whereon you see the letter G of the antient
form with a crown upon it and an escocheon with vine branch of
various small ones denoting St. Giles, to whom
dedicated.&rdquo;&nbsp; (These three niches are now empty.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;On the north side of Church there is no porch, but only a
door opposite to that of the south.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This doorway no
longer exists.)</p>
<p>The Church itself consists of new Chancel, Nave, and North and
South Aisles.&nbsp; The whole building is about 120 feet long,
and the nave with its aisles is 48 feet across.&nbsp; The roof is
of good open woodwork, supported by &ldquo;Angels bearing
shields, emblazoned with the Arms of England, France, and
Castile&rdquo; (Bayne).&nbsp; And Taylor says the Arms of Norwich
Priory are (or were) seen in this roof.&nbsp; The columns
supporting it are light and elegant.&nbsp; They are four in
number, with a pilaster at each end, and they divide the nave
from the aisles.&nbsp; The clerestory windows have been
modernised.&nbsp; They are five in number, and closely correspond
to the larger windows in the walls of the north and south
aisles.&nbsp; Of these there are five in <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the north
side, and four (and the porch) on the south side.</p>
<p>Blomefield says that &ldquo;In the west end of the south aisle
there was formerly a chapel, altar, and image of St. Catharine,
with a light burning before it; and against one of the pillars
there was a famous rood called the Brown-rood.&nbsp; There was a
Gild of St. Mary kept before the altar of the Virgin of
Pity.&nbsp; The west window in the north aisle was adorned with
the history of Our Lord&rsquo;s passion; and there were lights
burning before the images of St. Mary, St. John Baptist, St.
Christopher, St. Unkumber, and St. Wilegesartis; besides those
that continually burned before the Holy-rood, or cross, the Holy
Sepulchre, and the Sacrament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson says that S. Uncumber and S. Wilegesartis, or
Wylgefort, were the same person, and in the <i>St. Peter
Mountergate Parish Magazine</i> for February of this year (1891)
he has thus briefly given her history: &ldquo;She was a beautiful
maiden who was ordered to marry a man to whom she had a great
aversion.&nbsp; While she was at her wits&rsquo; end to know how
to avoid her fate, she was delighted to discover that in the
course of a few hours she had become adorned with a full-grown
and very ugly black beard.&nbsp; This, of course, disposed of the
gentleman.&nbsp; Wylgefort lived to be a happy old maid, and when
she died was honoured as a Saint . . .&nbsp; She was thought to
have some special power to uncumber (<i>i.e.</i> disencumber,
make free) discontented wives from disagreeable husbands.&nbsp;
Hence her popular name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remains of a colossal fresco painting of St. Christopher
and two consecration crosses were discovered on the wall of the
north aisle in 1723.</p>
<p>At the lower end of the Church stands an ancient stone
<i>Font</i>; the upper part, or basin, evidently of much older <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>date than the
base, which consists of a pedestal and two steps.&nbsp; The outer
part of the basin has eight facets, carved with shields and
flowers, and below these are eight cherubs&rsquo; heads, with
flowers between.&nbsp; The pedestal is carved out on its sides
into niches, having cusped tracery heads.&nbsp; There was
formerly a cover, which has been lost.&nbsp; Standing within the
large basin is a small leaden vessel and cover, a rough miniature
copy of the font itself, made about fifty years ago by Mr.
Culyer, then parish clerk.</p>
<p><i>The Communion Plate</i> <a name="citation97a"></a><a
href="#footnote97a" class="citation">[97a]</a> consists of six
pieces, silver gilt, and presented by Robert Snell in 1738, and
of two brass bowls, presented by Mr. John Gurney in 1869.</p>
<p>The reading desk and pulpit, the organ, the oak fittings, and
the vestry room were all added in 1866, when the whole Church was
restored, and the Chancel rebuilt. <a name="citation97b"></a><a
href="#footnote97b" class="citation">[97b]</a>&nbsp; The building
is thoroughly heated by hot water.&nbsp; The Communion rail was
added about five years ago.</p>
<p>The Church contains several monuments, besides mural tablets
and inscribed stones.&nbsp; The principal of the former are those
of</p>
<p class="gutindent">Adrian Payne, 1686, the founder of
Payne&rsquo;s Charity.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Robert Snell, 1738, who gave the Communion
Plate.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Alderman Churchman, 1742.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Dr. Offley, 1767.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Sir Thomas Churchman, 1781.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Dr. John Beevor, 1815.</p>
<p class="gutindent">The Stannard Family, 1838.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Slabs to the memory of Henry Crossgrove,
printer, 1744, who published the first Norwich newspaper in 1706;
and <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>to
Elizabeth, wife of Colonel Cobbe, of Sandringham Hall, 1698, may
also be mentioned.</p>
<p>There are several brasses, the two principal represent Robert
Baxter, Mayor of Norwich in 1424 and 1429, with his wife; and
Richard Purdaunce, Mayor 1422 and 1433, with his wife.&nbsp; Both
of these are figured in Cotman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brasses of
Norfolk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other and smaller brasses are inscribed with the names of John
Smith, Elizabeth Bedingfield, Margaret Landysdale, Thomas Hervey,
and Rachel Spendlove.</p>
<p><i>The Room over the Porch</i> contains some church standards
of former St. Giles&rsquo;s Mayors; also a dilapidated
&lsquo;Parish Umbrella&rsquo;; and the parish
&lsquo;Watchman&rsquo;s Crake,&rsquo; or rattle.</p>
<p><i>The Parish Registers</i> date from 1538, and are very
perfect.&nbsp; The Burial Register shows distinct evidence of the
presence of unusual mortality in some of the well-known
pestilence years.&nbsp; The first part contains a very remarkable
illustrated dedication.</p>
<p><i>The Churchyard</i> was altered and enclosed with a wall and
iron railing in 1866&ndash;7.&nbsp; Taylor says that a Hermitage
formerly existed in its south-west corner.</p>
<p>There are several and important parish <i>Charities</i>; their
proceeds being partly for Church purposes, and partly for the
benefit of poor parishioners.</p>
<p>The incumbency has an endowment of about &pound;70 a
year.&nbsp; It was formerly a Perpetual Curacy, and is now a
Vicarage.&nbsp; It is in the gift of the Dean and Chapter.&nbsp;
A vicarage house for the minister has been purchased quite
recently.</p>

THE TOWER OF ST. GILES&rsquo;S CHURCH,<br />
<i>And some things in relation thereto</i>. <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">By &ldquo;relation thereto&rdquo; I mean that
my paper will first speak of myself&mdash;my personality and my
belongings&mdash;and then recall to your memory a few of those
changes and events of interest which have taken place in my
neighbourhood and surroundings.</p>
<p>Perhaps I ought to apologize for bringing before such a
learned branch of the Church of England Young Men&rsquo;s
Society, as is this its Literary Class, so many familiar facts
and events as are here alluded to.&nbsp; But nevertheless, I have
thought that there might be some considerable interest in
grouping and recalling to our minds a few such items connected
with one city centre, and especially as they might be supposed to
be noted by such an eyewitness as I have suggested myself to
be.&nbsp; A knowledge of our city, of its specialities, its
changes, and developments, is always good mental store.&nbsp; And
although it might be said&mdash;are not many of these things to
be found recorded in the City Archives, and in the volumes of
City History? yet almost certainly many of the members of this
class will not have studied these.&nbsp; And therefore, it may
fairly be hoped that this little paper may stimulate the
historical <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>bump of some of the brains here present, and arouse in
them a desire to further study such arch&aelig;ological facts and
local histories.</p>
<p>And here let me quote some lines of the Suffolk poet, Bernard
Barton, in reference to the survey or study of past events or
history.&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No useless, or ignoble toil,<br />
To him who in &lsquo;the past&rsquo; delights,<br />
Seems it&mdash;from dark Oblivion&rsquo;s spoil<br />
To cull whate&rsquo;er our taste invites,<br />
Of by-gone legends, parted rites,<br />
In earlier days believ&rsquo;d as true;<br />
And bid our old &lsquo;Historic Sites&rsquo;<br />
Peopled afresh, to charm anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no true Philosophy<br />
Which does not love at times to trace,<br />
With glowing heart and moisten&rsquo;d eye,<br />
Time honoured haunts, whose chiefest grace<br />
Is to have been <i>their</i> dwelling-place<br />
Whose names in history&rsquo;s page are shrined,<br />
Whose memories time can ne&rsquo;er erase<br />
From many a fond admiring mind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well&mdash;my <i>name</i> and <i>title</i> is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Tower of
St. Giles&rsquo;s Church</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>and as such I shall speak of
some of the many things which I have seen</i>.</p>
<p>As you may suppose, from the prominent position which
I&mdash;the Tower&mdash;have for so many centuries occupied in
this old city of ours, I have long since ceased to suffer from
the undue modesty which so often accompanies equally deserving
but less conspicuous merit.&nbsp; I can only hope that you will
agree with my reasons for anticipating <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>from you
some of that appreciation and interest which I certainly take in
myself.&nbsp; And I propose to introduce my subject in the novel
way of speaking of myself as personal, and as having noted,
during my long life, various matters to which I shall call your
attention.</p>
<p>As an introduction, I am proud to think that I need only say,
once again, that I am the Tower of St. Giles&rsquo;s Church,
Norwich.&nbsp; And surely there cannot be many of our citizens
who are in the habit of passing up our broad street, St.
Giles&rsquo;s (the lower Newport as it used to be called), who
have not been struck with the fine proportions of my structure,
standing as I do at the head of this fine thoroughfare, and
looking and being an object of admiration for my beauty and my
striking position.&nbsp; Many are the beautiful views which I
present to the passer-by in the varying lights of the day, but my
beauty and grandeur are, I think, seen best of all, when in the
evening the sun is setting behind me in the west, or the moon
with her paler light throws down along the length of the main
street of St. Giles, those shadows, which&mdash;produced by my
intervening tower&mdash;are so well worthy of the admiration of
all who have eyes to see, and minds to appreciate, the glory of
evening views. <a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a></p>
<p>Let me say here in passing that Saint Giles, the saint after
whom I am named, appears to have lived in France; and history
relates that he was adopted as the typical <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Patron of
the crippled portion of humanity from his being himself lame, and
from his having been said to have effected a miraculous cure of a
sick beggar.&nbsp; As such Patron, parishes which, like mine,
were located on the outskirts of towns, have frequently been
given the name of St. Giles, as having had the duty, in the olden
time from their position, of contributing to the needs of passing
wayfarers, and of those requiring Christian charity.&nbsp; And
thus, in Norwich, not only was my own parish named after this
saint, but the so-called &ldquo;Old Man&rsquo;s Hospital,&rdquo;
in Bishopgate Street, at the other end of the city, was also
formerly called St. Giles&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Well, I am the Tower of St. Giles&rsquo;s Church, and I have
stood in my present position for at least five hundred years,
having been built (or rather rebuilt) in the time of King Richard
the Second (who ceased to reign in 1399).&nbsp; I am twenty-six
feet square, and I am also one of the tallest church towers in
Norwich.&nbsp; And not only so, but I stand in one of the most
conspicuous positions in the city, on the top of St.
Giles&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; I am a square Tower, built like the
adjoining Church, largely of flint stone, nearly 120 feet high,
battlemented at the top, and having also a small cupola or
bell-cup in the centre of my roof, with a conspicuous
weather-cock above this.&nbsp; In earlier times, in consequence
of my height and conspicuous position, I was used as a
Beacon-tower, <i>i.e.</i> a pail containing fuel was hung at one
of my corners, ready to be lighted as a danger signal in case of
invasion or other serious emergency.&nbsp; Such a beacon, as you
may know, was often called a &ldquo;Cresset,&rdquo; from the
French &ldquo;<i>Croisette</i>,&rdquo; which was a pail with a
cross on its top.</p>
<p>I am proud of my public spirit and loyalty, for on royal and
other special occasions, I raise on my summit a tall flag-staff,
and float from it a large and handsome flag.&nbsp; In <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>this, I am
sorry to say, I have too few imitators or companions amongst our
church towers, perhaps for the reason that even such loyalty as
this is expensive, and costs, I am told, some few shillings for
each such display.&nbsp; Amongst my various public uses, you have
probably all seen soldiers from the barracks on my roof
practising flag-drill in connection with others in Chapel
Field.</p>
<p>I have said that I am largely built of flint stone, which is
of a very enduring nature.&nbsp; In consequence I am thankful to
say that I have a very excellent constitution, and have stood the
wear and tear of a long life without requiring much fortifying or
repairing.&nbsp; I can only venture to hazard the bold suggestion
that my excellent health may also, in some mysterious way, have
been due to the near presence of so many Norwich doctors,
residing as they have so largely done in the neighbouring Bethel
and St. Giles&rsquo;s Streets!!&nbsp; At any rate, for a long
time past I had scarcely wanted professional assistance, until
about two years ago, when two of my windows (or eyes, as I call
them) needed technical help and repair.</p>
<p>Speaking of flint for building, we all know that some of the
finest flint work in the kingdom is to be seen in this city,
notably in St. Miles&rsquo;s Church, and in a wall in Bridewell
Alley.&nbsp; My flint work is inferior to these, but still
handsomely faced.&nbsp; No doubt the large use of flint stone in
building our Norwich churches was due to the abundant supply of
this material which has existed in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; And
with regard to myself it may well have been that my flints, or
some of them, may have been extracted from the ancient chalk
excavations which until lately existed just beyond St.
Giles&rsquo;s Gates.&nbsp; Mr. Walter Rye, as you perhaps know,
has also suggested that flints from these caves may have been
used in the building of both the Cathedral and the Norwich
Castle.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>As
curiously illustrating local specialities, one of my parishioners
has told me that when travelling some few years ago in Cornwall,
where granite and other hard rocks prevail, but no gravel or
flints, he asked one of the residents whom he met, if she knew of
flint stones, to which she replied, &ldquo;Oh! yes, I know
flints, I have seen one in the Museum at Torquay.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
much fear that not even one flint is to be seen in our grand
Museum on the Castle Hill!</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of myself (the Tower), I may mention
<span class="smcap">the Clock</span>, which has so long existed
on my eastern face, and which, judging from the constant
reference made to it by the passing throngs, is an undoubted
public boon.&nbsp; To the parish it is a source of some
expense.</p>
<p>This Clock was restored and re-coloured at the general
restoration of the Church in 1865&ndash;6, when the figure of
<i>Old Time</i>, holding a scythe in his hand (as many of us will
remember), was removed.&nbsp; The Clock face and Clock hands do
not look to the passer-by to be very large; but I find, on
measurement, that the diameter of the Clock face is 10 ft., that
the Roman letter numbers on it measure 1&frac12; ft., that the
length of the large hand is 6 ft. 5&frac12; in., with a weight of
21 lbs., and that of the small hand 3 ft. 4 in., with a weight of
8 lbs.&nbsp; My Clock has belonging to it a special Clock
Bell.</p>
<p>Then, as to my contents.&nbsp; As this is an Autobiography,
and as all Autobiographers are necessarily egotistical, you must
allow me to dwell a few minutes more upon my personal
specialities.&nbsp; And first, as to my <i>Peal of Bells</i>,
eight in number, which are naturally of great interest to myself,
and which hold a high place among the various peals of
Norwich.&nbsp; These, according to the high authority of the late
Mr. L&rsquo;Estrange, were placed in me between the years <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>1593, or
earlier, and 1738, and they were renovated and restored in 1870,
at the expense of Messrs. Browne, Bridgman, and Firth,
parishioners of St. Giles.&nbsp; (One of these bells is what is
called a <i>Gabriel</i> Bell&mdash;the &ldquo;Angel Gabriel
brought the good tidings to the Virgin Mary.&rdquo;)&nbsp; And
think for a moment what phases of life these bells have taken
part in during all these hundreds of years.&nbsp; I find that
since 1538, when our parish registers begin, some 2,524 entries
of <i>marriage</i> have been made in them.&nbsp; And it is
reasonable to suppose that at a fair proportion of these,
especially in earlier times, my bells have rung out their merry
chimes, and in their special language have wished all joy and
happiness to the newly wedded pairs.&nbsp; You remember how Byron
speaks of this: &ldquo;And all went merry as a marriage
bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, during the same period, or, rather, up to
1856, when interments in the Churchyard ceased by Act of
Parliament, <i>i.e.</i> in 318 years, nearly ten thousand (9,770,
as roughly counted) entries of <i>burials</i> here are made in
the parish register books.&nbsp; And it is almost certain that
one of my bells has announced first the fact of the death, and
then that of the mournful ceremony of interment, in each of these
cases.&nbsp; Just think, as I do, of all these ten thousand dead
lying at my foot, waiting, as Baring Gould has so beautifully
said, for the &ldquo;Resurrection morning,&rdquo; when
&ldquo;soul and body meet again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such an
accumulation of mortal remains in so limited a space may well
arouse much and solemn reflection.&nbsp; How well a Suffolk poet
reverently describes such a disused graveyard as mine now is,
where he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The gathered ashes of long centuries
rest;<br />
A few <i>white</i> tombstones and a few <i>dim-gray</i>,<br />
Mark names that have not yet quite passed away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Nor
can I fail to quote to you Gray&rsquo;s beautiful words, so
applicable to such a disused churchyard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hark! how the sacred calm, that breathes
around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease,<br />
In still small accents whispering from the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A grateful earnest of eternal peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The graveyard of St. Giles, which lies beneath and around me,
is, as I have already said, no longer used for burials.&nbsp; It
is quite full and crowded with graves and many memorial
tombstones.&nbsp; The names upon these, as far as legible, are
fully and completely given in the book which has been published
by a parishioner of mine, <a name="citation106"></a><a
href="#footnote106" class="citation">[106]</a> upon the
&ldquo;Parish of St. Giles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is historically interesting to know that the burial
registers, by the increased number of interments in some of the
long past years, point unmistakably to the prevalence in Norwich
at those times of the dread Pestilence or Plague, which is
recorded as having ravaged the city from time to time.&nbsp;
Thus, in 1603, no less than 112 persons were buried here; and in
1666, some 79&mdash;both of these &ldquo;Plague
years&rdquo;&mdash;instead of a normal average of twenty or
thirty.&nbsp; As you may suppose, I (the Tower) shared acutely in
the distress which then reigned in the city, intensified as it
was to me by the fact of three or four burials occasionally
taking place here in the same day.&nbsp; In some other years, an
increase of burials may probably have arisen from this place of
mortal rest having been a favourite one, and, therefore, selected
for the interment of some who had not been resident in the
parish.&nbsp; This was certainly so in the fifty years preceding
the closure of the churchyard, when fifty, sixty, or seventy were
often annually interred here.</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>But
to return to my bells.&nbsp; The perpetuation of the old custom
of ringing each night what is called the <i>Curfew Bell</i> in my
Tower is well known to us all.&nbsp; This Curfew ringing is now
an anachronism, but it doubtless was a great boon at the time of
its foundation, seeing that so many legacies were left in various
places, as here, for the purpose of having a &ldquo;Curfew&rdquo;
rung each night in perpetuity.</p>
<p>My Curfew Bell, instituted and endowed in 1457, by Mr. John
Colston, and who was buried in St. Giles&rsquo;s Church, has now
rung continuously for some 450 years.&nbsp; And although some
people may think this evening tolling of a bell for a quarter of
an hour a nuisance, it has in this particular case this merit,
that it acts, or has done, as a sort of daily almanac, seeing
that the day of the month is told at the end of the quarter of an
hour&rsquo;s ringing, each evening, by a number of strokes on a
different bell, corresponding to the day of the month.</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;Curfew,&rdquo; you doubtless know to be
derived from the French <i>Couvre-feu</i>, or cover fire.&nbsp;
And also that the custom in olden times of a public ringing of a
bell, or sounding a horn, for the putting out of fires and
retiring into houses for the night, arose from the out-door
dangers of those less civilised times, and from the inflammable
nature of many of the wooden and thatched houses then
existing.&nbsp; One such fire in Norwich (in 1507) is said to
have destroyed seven hundred houses, including many in my own
parish.&nbsp; Who does not know Gray&rsquo;s lines on this Curfew
custom?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Curfew tolls the knell of parting
day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lowing herd winds slowly o&rsquo;er the lea;<br
/>
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leaves the world to darkness and to
me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>And
we doubtless also remember Longfellow&rsquo;s beautiful verses on
this old custom:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Solemnly, mournfully,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dealing its dole,<br />
The Curfew Bell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is beginning to toll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cover the embers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And put out the light;<br />
Toil comes with the morning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rest with the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark grow the windows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And quenched is the fire;<br />
Sound fades into silence;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All footsteps retire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No voice in the chambers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No sound in the hall;<br />
Sleep and oblivion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reign over all!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all this, and what I have now said, I think I may claim
that I&mdash;the Tower&mdash;have fully discharged the general
duty of public usefulness, and am a great public
benefactor.&nbsp; My beacon pail is no longer required; but by my
weather-cock I tell the direction of the wind; by my clock I tell
the time of day; and by the final strokes of my curfew bell at
night, I act as an almanac, and tell the day of the
month&mdash;for the benefit not only of my neighbours, but to the
great multitude of the passers-by. <a name="citation108"></a><a
href="#footnote108" class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; And let it
not be forgotten that all this implies not only the discharge of
public duty, but also <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the expenditure of money, necessary
to keep the various arrangements for these in correct and working
order&mdash;money which has to be provided by the parish of St.
Giles.</p>
<p>Opinions as to the desirability of the ringing of the
<i>Church Bells</i> in towns differ, as we know,
considerably.&nbsp; And every now and then we read a letter in a
newspaper in condemnation of them.&nbsp; But I believe that those
who think thus are in a very small minority.&nbsp; I have said
how well they emphasize such occasions as weddings, and
funerals.&nbsp; And I think they most appropriately add to the
expression of public rejoicing on such occasions as the election
of a new Mayor, or a royal visit, or a royal anniversary&mdash;or
especially on the eve of such a great Christian festival as
Christmas or Easter.&nbsp; But beyond all this, I (the Tower)
consider that they are in the best sense public music, and that
when well rung this music is of a very high order indeed.&nbsp;
Who does not recognise the grandeur of the great twelve-bell peal
of St. Peter Mancroft, as rung by the skilled ringers of that
church, or the solemnity imparted to a public mourning by the
muffled peal occasionally rung, on the departure from this world
of some great local or national citizen?</p>
<p>In country villages I know that the possession of a good peal
of church bells is usually very highly appreciated, and the
practice of the ringing cannot be otherwise than an excellent
musical training for the young men of the parish.</p>
<p>It is curious how little regard <i>Jackdaws</i> pay to the
noise of clanging bells.&nbsp; In my tower, as elsewhere, they
habitually build their nests, and rear their young, apparently
quite free from alarm at the noise.&nbsp; From their constant
selection of church towers as breeding <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>places, may
we not suppose that these birds have ears for music, or may even
practice singing amongst their family parties, to the
accompanying chimes?</p>
<p>I have windows on all four of my sides, and until lately
(1866), when the Church was so thoroughly restored, I had an eye
in my lower eastern portion which enabled me to view the changes
which have taken place in the interior of the Church.&nbsp; Long,
long ago, I noted the dilapidation of the Chancel, and its final
demolition and removal (in 1581), on a bargain being made by
which the parish was allowed to take all the remaining lead,
stone, and other materials (for some parochial charity) belonging
to it, on condition that the Dean and Chapter were no longer to
be held liable for its repair.&nbsp; This <i>Chancel</i> I had
the pleasure of seeing rebuilt in 1866, mainly through the
beneficence of Rev. Canon Ripley, then incumbent of the vicarage,
when also the Church was finely restored, and reseated.</p>
<p>You are aware that the years 1903&ndash;4 represent the
five-hundredth anniversary of the giving of a Mayor to the City
of Norwich.&nbsp; Several St. Giles&rsquo;s inhabitants have held
this important office, as well as that of Sheriff, during all
those centuries, but I will only specially mention the names of
<i>Richard Purdaunce</i> and of <i>Robert Baxter</i>, who were
very early Mayors, in 1420 and 1424 respectively, and who were
interred in the nave of this Church, with brasses over their
tombs.&nbsp; These still remain, and are of considerable interest
as showing the costumes of the period.</p>
<p>And now as to the parish of St. Giles itself, in which I
stand, I cannot but recall with satisfaction the large number of
residents who have been in their day most important and
influential citizens in various departments of life.&nbsp; As
public men I will only mention the <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>names of a few such departed
neighbours whose careers and public services I have
watched.&nbsp; Let us only recall the names (given
alphabetically) in public life of such examples as Baxter,
Beevor, Bolingbroke, Cadge, Chapman, Churchman, Cole, Crosse,
Day, Foster, Herring, Kinghorn, Johnson, Lubbock, Offley,
Purdaunce, Ranking, Rigby, Suffield, Taylor, Wilkins; or as
ornaments of the literary and artistic world, such names as
Brand, Blomefield, Borrow, Crossgrove, Charlotte Elizabeth,
Daniel, Ninham&mdash;and now we may add that of Bateman.&nbsp;
This, you will agree with me, is a goodly list, and marks out St.
Giles&rsquo;s parish as having been one of the most important
residential districts in the city, and as having largely
contributed to its welfare and general reputation.&nbsp; And in
this regard we may well regret that so many of the fine parish
residences have been or are being absorbed by public companies or
other bodies; and that in consequence, the most actively
important men of the city are gradually being driven to other and
more distant localities.&nbsp; And we may even note here how the
neighbouring and almost historical old &ldquo;Norfolk
Hotel&rdquo; has been swept away, and its site occupied by a
modern variety theatre.</p>
<p>Further, as a sign of the times, I may mention to you a spot
in St. Giles&rsquo;s Street, situated behind
&ldquo;Mortimer&rsquo;s Hotel,&rdquo; which was long known as
&ldquo;<i>Mack&rsquo;s Yard</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Mack was for a
long period the enterprising proprietor of some carrier waggons,
which made a weekly journey to and from London, carrying parcels
and goods.&nbsp; This was in the days when the stage coaches to
London occupied two days in the journey; and when the starting of
these coaches, as well as of Mack&rsquo;s waggons, was an
interesting incident of Norwich life.</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>So
much for my immediate personal relations.&nbsp; Let me now look a
little further around and beyond me.</p>
<p>No doubt, almost everyone present this evening, when crossing
Mousehold Park, or when passing along the roads on the outskirts
of the city, will have noted how I&mdash;the Tower&mdash;stand
out more prominently than any other object than the Castle or the
Cathedral spire.&nbsp; And, on the other hand, those of our
younger citizens who may have ascended to my summit, can bear
testimony to the wide and expanded views from it of the
surrounding country.&nbsp; In fact, I command a view, not only of
much of the city, but also of the neighbourhood for many miles
around.&nbsp; And this commanding position has enabled me to note
most of those great changes, and improvements, which have taken
place&mdash;by slow degrees and with many fluctuations&mdash;in
the city generally.&nbsp; And, of course, I have keenly felt the
change in my own position which the recent spread of the city all
around me has produced.&nbsp; Not so very long ago I was situated
in its very outskirts, and very close to the boundary City
Walls.&nbsp; Now, I am almost in the heart of Norwich, and from
my summit I can see the lines of houses extending a mile or more
beyond me, and, I fear, detracting by their extent from the
conspicuous dignity of the position which I had so long
enjoyed.</p>
<p>Of the many more distant but important Norwich events of the
past centuries, which from my lofty position I have been enabled
to witness, I will only mention two or three which have specially
impressed me, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>In King Edward VI.&rsquo;s reign, I was able to note many of
the incidents connected with Kett&rsquo;s Rebellion.</p>
<p>A little later, I saw the reflection of the fires at the
Lollard&rsquo;s pit, when Bilney and others were there burnt for
their religious opinions.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>I saw
the processions attending the visits to Norwich of Queen
Elizabeth, and of King Charles II.&nbsp; And you will remember
that it was on this latter occasion that our distinguished
citizen, Sir Thomas Browne, to whom we have so recently erected a
statue, received the honour of Knighthood from his Sovereign.</p>
<p>Then again, I was cognizant of the blowing down of the
Cathedral spire, during a great storm, in 1601; and of the spire
of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall tower.</p>
<p>And, shall I say, with how much regret in quite later times, I
witnessed the riotous and disgraceful scenes which took place at
some of the Parliamentary elections held in
Norwich&mdash;followed, as we know, by the exciting but not too
pleasant &ldquo;Chairing&rdquo; of the elected candidates.</p>
<p>In my more immediate neighbourhood I have watched the
foundation (in 1714) and the subsequent career of that beautiful
example of Christian charity, the well-known Bethel Hospital for
the poorer class of insane patients.&nbsp; We all know that in
those earlier times, simply to remove from the general community
and to house those suffering from mental derangement, was all
that was known to be able to be done for those thus
afflicted.&nbsp; But I have been charmed to note from my
window-eyes how greatly their treatment has been improved in
latter times, and to watch with pathetic interest the great
changes which have been made, and are still continually being
made, for the comfort and recreation and general welfare of the
patients in this beneficent institution. <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a></p>
<p>Very numerous and historically important are the changes and
advances and improvements which have <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>taken place in our city during the
last 150 years, and which I have witnessed from my lofty
summit.</p>
<p>In 1770, I saw the first <i>Norfolk and Norwich Hospital</i>
built, and I have seen the old building replaced (in
1879&ndash;1881) by a larger and handsomer structure.</p>
<p>In 1792, I saw our <i>St. Giles&rsquo;s Gate</i>, along with
many others, taken down and removed; whilst, in 1867, I saw much
of the neighbouring <i>City Wall</i> demolished, only a small
piece of it being left in the Chapel Field Road, and in the
adjacent &ldquo;Duck Lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will remember that this defensive wall was built around
the city between the years 1294 and 1319, and was broken down
between the St. Stephen&rsquo;s and St. Giles&rsquo;s Gates by
Earl Warwick&rsquo;s army, in the time of Kett&rsquo;s
Rebellion.</p>
<p>Then I have seen numerous churches and chapels, factories, and
other large buildings, arise in various parts of the
city&mdash;these latter including the Norwich Union Workhouse,
the Jenny Lind Infirmary, and (in the far distance) the Hellesdon
Asylum.</p>
<p>I have also witnessed the laying-out of the new Norwich
Cemetery, and its more recent enlargement.&nbsp; And at my very
foot I have noted the erection of our Volunteer Drill Hall, and
the removal of the old City Gaol.&nbsp; The closure of this
latter, and of the Castle as a prison, and their replacement by a
single model prison on Mousehold Hill, marking the advances of
the times and the progressive development of political
humanity.</p>
<p>Of the grand Castle Museum, which is in my full view, I need
say nothing.&nbsp; Its influence in spreading knowledge, and in
developing the higher and better faculties of the mind, are
obvious to all.&nbsp; I am pleased to learn of the interest taken
in it by the public, as shown by the visiting of it by the more
than 100,000 persons who annually resort to it.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>If I
do not weary you, I would now like to claim your attention for a
very few minutes to what may fairly be termed my &ldquo;Home
Circle,&rdquo; that is, to the events which I have witnessed
immediately around me in <i>recent</i> times.&nbsp; Several of
these have been closely connected with the neighbouring
&ldquo;<i>Chapel Field</i>,&rdquo; formerly a real and open
field, but now a charming recreation garden, and one of the
beauty spots of our city, with the present handsome palisading
around it, erected in 1866.&nbsp; The avenues of trees which
adorn this field are, or were, one of its great features.</p>
<p>And it is worth noting that Norwich history relates that the
main west avenue was planted in 1746 by Sir Thomas Churchman,
then a resident in St. Giles&rsquo;s parish and an important
citizen.&nbsp; The ordinary age of elm trees is (I believe) not
greatly more than a century and a-half, and consequently some of
these trees have decayed in their branches or trunks.&nbsp; But
until a few months ago a long row of the elms towered up to their
eighty or ninety feet of height, in great beauty and apparent
vigour.&nbsp; I need not say with what pain I looked down upon
the process of lopping and topping which was carried out upon
these, or how I grieved over such a dire necessity for this
operation as was alleged to exist.</p>
<p>One other example of tree grandeur existed until the other day
in the northern avenue, namely, a splendid specimen of the
<i>Aspen Poplar</i>, towering nearly one hundred feet high, and
an object of extreme beauty to all who could appreciate such
arboreal grandeur.&nbsp; Even so long ago as 1841 this tree was
figured by <i>Grigor</i> in his work on &ldquo;The Remarkable
Trees of Norfolk,&rdquo; as a fine example of this poplar.&nbsp;
And we may well feel how the further sixty-three years of its
life had added to its size, its dignity, and its grandeur.&nbsp;
I greatly regret that <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>since the late great gale it has
been thought necessary to remove several of its upper branches,
and so destroy all its grandeur.&nbsp; But the old line,
&ldquo;Woodman, spare that tree&rdquo; for the greatest possible
length of time was, I hope, fully in the minds of those who
presided over its fate.</p>
<p>The splendid <i>Horse-Chestnut</i> tree near the centre of the
field is familiar to us all, and I have watched its growth and
circular uniformity with pleasure and interest.</p>
<p>This Chapel Field, as you may know, takes it name from a
Chapel of St. Mary, which formerly existed on the site of the
present Theatre and High School buildings.&nbsp; At that time the
ground was really an open field; and it seems to have been
acquired by the Corporation in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Probably few, and perhaps none, of those present in this room,
can remember as I do the big water reservoir of the proprietors
of the Norwich Water Works of that date, which formerly existed
in Chapel Field, near its centre, on ground leased by them from
the Corporation.&nbsp; This reservoir was large, nearly three
hundred yards in circumference, and had on its north side a
tower, into which water was forced to gain height for supplying
the higher portions of the city.&nbsp; It remained here from 1792
until 1852, just sixty years, when the lease of the ground was
surrendered, the works demolished, and the new and enlarged
reservoirs of the present Norwich Water Works Company, at
Lakenham, were substituted.</p>
<p>I may mention here a rumour which reached me, and which I have
no doubt was true, that in April, 1852, the Corporation of
Norwich proposed to place the statue of Lord Nelson, which had
just then been executed for Norwich, &ldquo;on an elegant
fountain pedestal <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>in the centre of this reservoir,&rdquo; which was then
about to be disused. <a name="citation117"></a><a
href="#footnote117" class="citation">[117]</a></p>
<p>I have, of course, noted many public events which have taken
place in the Chapel Field&mdash;martial, agricultural, and
otherwise.&nbsp; But naturally, a great impression has been made
upon me by observing the historical visits of their Royal
Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales (now our gracious
King and Queen) in 1866 and 1884, on both which occasions they
entered Norwich by St. Giles&rsquo;s Gates.&nbsp; The visit of
1866 was, as you will remember, the first they had paid to
Norwich, and they were then entertained by Lord and Lady
Stafford, at Costessey Hall.&nbsp; The royal party then included
the Queen of Denmark (mother of the Princess), and the Duke of
Edinburgh; and the procession entered our street under a
<i>triumphal arch</i> erected on the site of the old St.
Giles&rsquo;s Gate.&nbsp; They then attended a morning concert of
the Musical Festival then being held; and afterwards returned to
Chapel Field, where the Prince and Princess each planted a
&ldquo;Wellingtonia&rdquo; tree, and afterwards formally opened
the new <i>Drill Hall</i>.</p>
<p>In 1884 they again attended our Musical Festival, and entered
and left the city by St. Giles&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>On both these occasions I noted with great pleasure the large
crowds of citizens who lined the route of the processions, and
the enthusiastic manner in which they welcomed our royal
visitors.</p>
<p>All will remember the recent visit of T.R.H. the Duke and
Duchess of York (now the Prince and Princess <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>of Wales),
when they came to open our new Castle Museum.&nbsp; But my views
of the royal procession were from my position unfortunately
considerably limited.&nbsp; I am glad, however, to know that one
of my parishioners was Mayor of Norwich, and as such had the
honour to receive and entertain the distinguished party.</p>
<p>I&mdash;the Tower&mdash;have several eyes, but no proper ears,
only vibratory sensations, and consequently can only hear
indistinctly the sweet sounds of the various bands and singers
that now delight so many thousands of Norwich citizens during the
summer season in Chapel Field.&nbsp; But that these musical
entertainments are appreciated, I can <i>see</i> by the large
numbers of persons who attend the concerts and listen to the
music provided for them.&nbsp; It is not to be doubted that these
frequent musical treats constitute a veritable branch of mental
education.</p>
<p>In the city generally, I have during the last half century
noted the opening of several parks and public recreation grounds,
and I have watched with pleasure the gradually increasing numbers
of citizens, old and young, who avail themselves of the
opportunities which these afford for obtaining fresher air,
exercise, health, and vitality.&nbsp; Amongst these, you may be
sure of the special and daily delight I take in watching the
games and gymnastics of the children, in the corner of Chapel
Field just below me, which has been allotted to them, and which
was so kindly fitted up for them by the late Mr. Henry
Birkbeck.</p>
<p>I will only further say, of the many vast changes and items of
social progress in latter years, that I have seen with wonder and
astonishment the advent of steam carriages, and the opening in
Norwich of three railway stations, receiving trains, some of
which have travelled more than fifty miles an hour.&nbsp; Also
that as an illuminant, I was long familiar only with the use of
oil, shedding its feeble light, <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>this being superseded by the gas
derived from coal.&nbsp; But, quite recently, I have opened my
eyes to their widest to observe the lighting of our windows and
streets with electric light, and the working of tram carriages
upon rails through our main streets (including my own street of
St. Giles) by means of the electric current.</p>
<p>Norwich generally, like other cities and towns, has in the
centuries marched along the line of steady and continuous
developments.&nbsp; Such a brief mention as I have made of some
of these is all that can now be given.&nbsp; To give a larger
<i>local</i> history of these latter eventful times would occupy
us too long, and would not only be tedious to such an audience as
this, but would be beyond my present purpose.&nbsp; I shall be
more than satisfied if, by the little I have said, I have shown
how much of interest there is in the study of even one locality
in an ancient city like Norwich, and in recalling some of the
half-forgotten facts connected more or less intimately with it;
and if, as a secondary result, it should create, or revive, in
the members of this literary class a wish to include amongst its
contributed papers and subjects for future consideration and
discussion, that branch of literature which is included under the
name of local Arch&aelig;ology.&nbsp; For we must not forget that
past history includes the study, not only of work done and
changes executed, but also a consideration of the men, the human
minds, through whose agency this work and the resulting changes
were carried out.&nbsp; And I trust that we shall all agree with
Dr. Johnson that &ldquo;Whatever makes the past, the distant, or
the future, predominate over the present, advances us in the
dignity of human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I would venture here to quote the following from a late
learned writer on Norwich (Mr. Mark Knights), who has said:
&ldquo;Wonderful is the amount of thought enveloped <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>in the
buildings and history of Norwich.&nbsp; Would that every citizen
had the power to evoke from the monuments of the past the spirit
which gave them form, that they might read their
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me conclude by quoting the following opinion from the
well-known pages of &ldquo;Gilbert White of Selborne,&rdquo; with
reference to such a local and parochial history as I have
ventured to place before you this evening.&nbsp; This great
authority expresses very strongly the view that &ldquo;stationary
men should pay attention to the districts in which they reside,
and should publish their thoughts respecting the objects that
surround them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, that a writer upon these
(as he himself so learnedly was), if he should &ldquo;have lent a
helping hand towards the enlargement of the boundaries of
historical and topographical knowledge; or if he should have
thrown even some small light upon ancient customs and manners,
his purpose would have been fully answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is for you to judge whether I have succeeded in
placing before you any interesting facts &ldquo;respecting the
objects which surround us,&rdquo; and have &ldquo;contributed to
the enlargement of the boundaries of (<i>your</i>) historical and
topographical knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have expressed some opinions, and placed before you many
facts.&nbsp; I hope these may provoke some profitable comments or
discussion.</p>

SIR THOMAS BROWNE.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A Paper read at a Meeting of the C.E.Y.M.S.
Literary Class, on Monday, March 12th, 1894. <a
name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121"
class="citation">[121]</a></p>
<p>I am glad to redeem my promise to read a paper before this
Literary Class, during this present session, upon one of our most
noted British Authors, and I have thought that I could not do
better than to bring before your notice one of those who
literally resided at our very doors; and whose works&mdash;if not
so generally read as those of many other writers&mdash;are not
the less deserving of careful study, and will well repay any time
spent upon their perusal.&nbsp; In fact, I make bold to say that
the more they are studied, the more does the great learning
displayed in them impress itself upon us, and the more also does
the high moral nature of the Author make itself felt.&nbsp; I
could well have wished that this brief notice had been more
elaborate and more worthy of the Author, but I may well plead the
great public demands which have recently been made upon my time;
and which often have been so numerous and so continuous, as to
leave but little time for literary work or thought, or indeed for
anything but the ordinary duties of <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>each day as it comes round.&nbsp;
The Author whom I have selected for notice this evening is <i>Sir
Thomas Browne</i>, long a resident in this city, for many years a
practising physician here; a gentleman who enjoyed the highest
reputation even in his own lifetime, as a man of high character
and great literary attainments; who enjoyed personal and literary
acquaintanceship with many of the greatest men of his day; and
whose works attracted the notice of the learned and the great
from the first moment of their public appearance.</p>
<p>The house in which Sir Thomas Browne resided is the one
immediately opposite to the entrance to this building; and a
portion of it is now the Norfolk and Norwich Savings Bank, just
across the street.&nbsp; I am unable to say how far Sir Thomas
Browne&rsquo;s house extended at the time of his occupation of
it; undoubtedly many of the buildings to the north and east of it
have been erected since his time; and as we are told of his
extensive garden adjoining it, it is probable that this latter
extended far up to, or possibly even on to Orford Hill.&nbsp; It
is also believed that he had another garden somewhere upon
Mousehold.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne was not a native of Norwich, for he appears
to have been born in London in 1605.&nbsp; He settled in practice
here in 1634 or 1636, and continued to reside here until 1682,
when he died at the age of 77 years.&nbsp; He was buried in the
chancel of St. Peter Mancroft church in this city, and a tablet
to his memory hangs on the adjoining wall, with a notable
inscription, which any of you can go and see for yourselves, but
which is too long for me to reproduce here.</p>
<p>I am able to show you an engraving from a portrait of him
which long hung neglected in the Vestry Room of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, but which now occupies a more worthy position on
the walls of the Board Room of the Norfolk and Norwich <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Hospital.
<a name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123"
class="citation">[123]</a>&nbsp; I can also show you a copy of
the 7th edition of his works, dated 1686.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne was knighted in 1671, on the occasion of a
visit of King Charles II. to this city.&nbsp; The King at first
offered to confer this honour upon the Mayor of Norwich, but his
worship declining the compliment, Dr. Thomas Browne was knighted
in his stead.</p>
<p>I have said that Sir Thomas Browne was buried in the Chancel
of St. Peter Mancroft Church.&nbsp; Here he appears to have
rested in peace for nearly two hundred years, when in
1840&mdash;as recorded by Mr. Fitch&mdash;(Proceedings of the
Arch&aelig;ological Institute, 1847) &ldquo;Some workmen who were
employed in digging a vault in the Chancel of the Church of St.
Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft, Norwich, accidentally broke, with a blow
of the pick axe, the lid of a coffin, which proved to be that of
one whose residence within its walls conferred honour on Norwich
in olden times.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The bones of the skeleton
were found to be in good preservation, particularly those of the
skull; the hair profuse and perfect, of a fine auburn colour,
similar to that in the portrait presented to the parish by Dr.
Howman&rdquo; (who in later times occupied his house, now the
Savings Bank).</p>
<p>The coffin plate bore a Latin inscription, which was
translated by the late Mr. Firth, of this city,
thus&mdash;&ldquo;The very distinguished man, Sir Thomas Browne,
Knight, Doctor of Medicine, aged 77 years, who died on the 19th
of October, in the year of our Lord, 1682, sleeping in this
coffin of lead, by the dust of his alchemic body transmuted it
into a coffer of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are all, doubtless, familiar with the fact that the skull
of this great man was then taken away, and finally presented to
the Museum of the Norfolk and Norwich <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Hospital, where, along with a lock
of his hair, it still remains, carefully preserved and held in
high honour.&nbsp; And you have doubtless heard and read of the
efforts which have recently been made to re-obtain possession of
it and again consign it to its mother earth.&nbsp; The numerous
letters and papers which have appeared in the public press,
discussing this question, are also fresh in all your minds, and
give nearly every aspect of the matter.&nbsp; One good thing at
least they have affected, and that is, to bring Sir Thomas
Browne&rsquo;s name into greater prominence than for many long
years.&nbsp; And I have no doubt that this incident, together
with a reviving interest in the works of this great Norwich
writer and thinker, have resulted in his being more famous to-day
in Norwich than at any former period since that of his actual
residence here and of the years immediately following his
decease.</p>
<p>Much has been made, during this discussion, of a paragraph in
Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s disquisition on urn-burial.&nbsp; He is
said to have, almost prophetically, described this incident of
the removal of his own skull from his tomb, when he wrote
&ldquo;to be <i>knaved</i> out of our graves, to have our skulls
made drinking bowls, and our bones turned into pipes, to delight
and sport our enemies, are tragical abominations escaped in
burning burials.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, I think the whole force of
this extract is removed by turning to Wilkin&rsquo;s edition,
where this passage runs, &ldquo;to be <i>gnawed</i> (not knaved)
out of our graves,&rdquo; which clearly gives it a very different
meaning.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne married a few years after settling in
Norwich (in 1641), a daughter of Edward Mileham, Esq., of
Burlingham St. Peter, in this county, and granddaughter of John
Hobart, Esq., by whom he had ten children.&nbsp; Of these ten,
his eldest son, Dr. Edward Browne, became very eminent in his
profession.&nbsp; He practised in <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>London, where he was made Physician
to King Charles II., and he was afterwards appointed Physician to
St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, and later became President of
the Royal College of Physicians.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne appears to have enjoyed for many years a
very considerable practice in this city.&nbsp; But he was also an
arch&aelig;ologist, a naturalist, a studier of plants and
animals.&nbsp; He had as personal friends or literary
correspondents such men as Sir Robert Paston, Sir Hamon
L&rsquo;Estrange, Sir Kenelm Digby, John Evelyn, Sir William
Dugdale, and Bishop Hall, and he appears to have found time to
carry on a very large literary correspondence.&nbsp; He lived in
Norwich from 1634 to 1682, which included the dangerous times of
the Stuarts, of the Long Parliament, and of the
Commonwealth.&nbsp; But he appears to have been a staunch
Royalist.&nbsp; He was knighted, as I have said, by King Charles
II., on the occasion of his visiting Norwich in 1671.</p>
<p>Later in this year he was visited by the well-known Evelyn,
whose oft quoted passage respecting him runs thus&mdash;&ldquo;My
Lord Henry Howard . . . would needs have me go with him to
Norwich, promising to convey me back after a day or two; this, as
I could not refuse, I was not hard to be persuaded to, having a
desire to see that famous scholar and physitian, Dr. T. Browne,
author of the &lsquo;Religio Medici,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vulgar
Errors,&rsquo; etc., now lately knighted.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
adds, &ldquo;Next morning I went to see Sir Tho. Browne (with
whom I had some time corresponded by letter, tho&rsquo; I had
never seen him before).&nbsp; His whole house and garden being a
paradise and cabinet of rarities, and that of the best
collections, especially medails, books, plants, and natural
things.&nbsp; Amongst other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a
collection of the eggs of all the foule and birds he could
procure. . . .&nbsp; He led me to see all <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>the
remarkable places of this ancient citty being one of the largest,
and certainly, after London, one of the noblest of England, for
its venerable Cathedrall, number of stately churches, cleanesse
of the streetes, and buildings of flints, so exquisitely headed
and squared, as I was much astonished at. . . .&nbsp; The Castle
is an antique extent of ground, which now they call Marsfield,
and would have been a fitting area to have placed the ducal
palace on.&nbsp; The suburbs are large, the prospects sweete,
with other amenities, not omitting the flower gardens, in which
all the inhabitants excel.&nbsp; The fabric of stuffs brings a
vast trade to this populous towne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne was, as is evident from even a cursory study
of his works, a great student.&nbsp; He understood most of the
European languages, Latin and Greek critically, and a little
Hebrew, and it is quite certain that he must have studied
carefully, not only the Christian Scriptures, but also the works
of many of the ancient fathers of the Christian Church.&nbsp; His
memory of what he had read must have been prodigious.&nbsp; But
though he was so learned a man, a traveller, a student of
languages, a naturalist, a medical practitioner, and in many
respects doubtless ahead of his time, yet a sad blot exists upon
his generally great character, and scientific acumen.&nbsp; I
allude to the evidence which he gave at Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s,
in 1664, at the trial before Lord Chief Baron Hale, of two women
for witchcraft.&nbsp; Sir Thomas appears to have been a firm
believer in witches and witchcraft, and the declaration which he
made to this effect &ldquo;was thought to have had no small
influence in occasioning the condemnation of the wretched
victims, whose execution was one of the latest instances of the
kind by which the English annals are disgraced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his death his widow resided in his house until her <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>death.&nbsp; Then it was occupied by Dr. Howman, who
presented the portrait of the knight to St. Peter&rsquo;s
Mancroft.&nbsp; A large portion of his letters and manuscripts
passed into the hands of Sir Hans Sloane, and are now in our
National Library at the British Museum.</p>
<p>During this present century the house has been dismantled and
converted to its new purposes, and its fittings dispersed.&nbsp;
A handsome carved mantel-piece, removed from one of the rooms by
the builder, is now in the possession of Mr. Henry Birkbeck, of
Stoke; and the very keys of the house were long treasured as
relics by the late Mr. Barker, of Thorpe Hamlet.</p>
<p>But I must not dwell longer upon his personality and personal
history, interesting though they be, in the light of his being a
Norwich man, and the most famous of Norwich authors.&nbsp; If you
wish to know more of his biography, you will find it all
excellently given in the memoir of him written by Dr. Samuel
Johnson, and which, together with a supplemental memoir by Simon
Wilkin, is prefaced to the edition of his works in three volumes,
published by Bohn in 1852, and edited by Wilkin.</p>
<p>We must next consider to what Sir Thomas Browne owes his great
literary fame, and upon what his claims rest for being one of
this city&rsquo;s most eminent citizens.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne was a very voluminous writer, and he touched
a great variety of subjects.&nbsp; The greatest of his works, the
one which was published soon after his settling in Norwich, was
undoubtedly that to which he gave the name of &ldquo;<i>Religio
Medici</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the religion of a physician; implying
thereby, not &ldquo;that physicians have a religion to
themselves, but that physicians have religion as well as other
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; It immediately attracted the attention of the
most learned in the land, and it is certainly the production upon
which his literary fame most largely <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>depends.&nbsp; It is quaintly
written, full of odd phrases, original thoughts, and
peculiarities of diction, but equally full of fine sentiments and
expressions of confident religious faith.&nbsp; It is a work
often so quaint in its diction, so stilted in its modes of
expression (as indeed was common in those days), and so
interlarded with specialized or new-coined words, that it is
somewhat difficult to read and understand.&nbsp; But its high
qualities and beauties are so great that it richly repays the
trouble of mastering its style; and I venture to assert that the
greatness of its sentiments and thoughts grows upon one by
perusal, and that the oftener it is read the more greatly will it
be appreciated.</p>
<p>To show what was thought of it from the first, it had, by the
year 1736, passed through fourteen editions, and had also been
translated into Latin, French, Dutch and German.</p>
<p>Now let me briefly quote a few passages from this
&ldquo;<i>Religio Medici</i>,&rdquo; to show the views and
opinions upon the Christian religion which are therein set
forth.</p>
<p>First, Sir T. Browne says, &ldquo;I dare without usurpation
assume the honourable style of a Christian, not that I merely owe
this title to the font, or any education . . . but that having in
my riper years and confirmed judgement, seen and examined all, I
find myself obliged by the principles of grace, and the law of
mine own reason, to embrace no other name but this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, whilst professing himself a member of the reformed
faith, he shows the great charity of his mind by saying &ldquo;I
could never divide myself from any man upon the difference of an
opinion, or be angry with his judgement for not agreeing with me
in that from which perhaps within a few days I should dissent
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And speaking of Death, he says &ldquo;I hold the same conceit
(of the soul) that we all do of the body, that it <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>should rise
again,&rdquo; and in all humility he adds &ldquo;so that I might
enjoy my Saviour at the last, I could with patience be nothing
almost unto eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the many difficulties and mysteries of our religion, he
expresses an almost blind faith in all that is written.&nbsp; He
writes &ldquo;I desire to exercise my faith in the difficultest
point: for to credit ordinary and visible objects, is not faith,
but pursuasion;&rdquo; again, he craves by faith &ldquo;that
greater blessing pronounced to all that believe and saw
not,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;God hath not made a creature that can
comprehend him; &rsquo;tis a privilege of his own nature.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>I am</i>, <i>that I am</i>,&rsquo; was his own
definition unto Moses; and &rsquo;twas a short one to confound
mortality, that durst question God, or ask him what he
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of natural, as a confirmation of revealed religion,
he says &ldquo;there are two books from whence I collect my
divinity.&nbsp; Besides that written one of God, another of his
servant nature, that universal and publick manuscript, that lies
expansed unto the eyes of all.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor do I
so forget God as to adore the name of nature, which I define not,
with the schools, to be the principle of motion and rest, but
that straight and regular line, that settled and constant course
the wisdom of God hath ordained the actions of his creatures,
according to their several kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as a comfort to the comparatively weak, he says, in
speaking of Christian martyrs, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not in the power
of every honest faith to proceed thus far, or to pass to Heaven
through the flames. . . .&nbsp; Yet men may, notwithstanding, in
a peaceful way, truly adore their Saviour, and have, no doubt, a
faith acceptable in the eyes of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These extracts are quite sufficient to show you the tone in
which this great work was written; and to disprove the <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>allegation
made by some against Browne of having written an Atheistical
book.&nbsp; It is remarkable that it was placed by the Roman
Church in the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne wrote yet another religious or
semi-religious book, which was entitled &ldquo;<i>Christian
Morals</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is very different in style from the
one just mentioned, and the manner is more that of proverbs or
aphorisms.</p>
<p>He commences by saying &ldquo;Tread softly and circumspectly
in this . . . narrow path of goodness; pursue virtue virtuously;
leaven not good actions, nor render virtue
disputable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;In this virtuous voyage of
thy life . . . let not disappointment cause despondency, nor
difficulty despair.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rest not in an ovation,
but a triumph over thy passions.&nbsp; Let anger walk hanging
down the head; let malice go manacled, and envy fettered after
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be charitable before wealth make thee covetous, and
lose not the glory of the mite.&nbsp; If riches increase, let thy
mind hold pace with them, and think it not enough to be liberal,
but munificent.&nbsp; Though a cup of cold water may not be
without its reward, yet stick not thou for wine and oil for the
wounds of the distressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let not the law of thy country be the <i>non ultra</i>
of thy honesty. . . .&nbsp; Join Gospel righteousness with legal
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath, but write thy
wrongs in ashes.&nbsp; Draw the curtain of night upon injuries,
shut them up in the tower of oblivion, and let them be as though
they had not been.&nbsp; To forgive our enemies, yet hope that
God will punish them, is not to forgive enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think not that always good which thou thinkest thou can
always make good, nor that concealed which <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the sun
doth not behold.&nbsp; There is no darkness unto conscience;
which can see without light, and in the deepest obscurity give a
clear draught of things, which the cloud of dissimulation hath
concealed from all eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As final quotations from &ldquo;<i>Christian Morals</i>&rdquo;
let me give these sentences, &ldquo;Bright thoughts, clear deeds,
constancy, fidelity, bounty, and generous honesty, are the gems
of noble minds,&rdquo;&mdash;and</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live happy in the Elysium of a virtuously composed
mind. . . .&nbsp; Tranquility is better than jollity, and to
appease pain than to invent pleasure. . . .&nbsp; Forget not the
capital end, and frustrate not the opportunity of once living. .
. .&nbsp; Think every day the last, and live always beyond thy
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I want neither to tire you, nor to read you a sermon at
second-hand.&nbsp; So having now shown you the religious side of
Browne&rsquo;s character, let me give you some idea of his
learning and acquirements and general industry.</p>
<p>In his grand treatise on <i>Hydriotaphia</i> or
<i>Urn-burial</i>, which he wrote consequent upon the discovery
of some ancient sepulchral urns at Old Walsingham, in Norfolk, he
exemplifies the great stores of knowledge which by his reading
and memory he had accumulated.&nbsp; He quaintly prefaces this
treatise by saying, &ldquo;Who knows the fate of his bones, or
how often he is to be buried?&nbsp; Who hath the oracle of his
ashes, or whither they are to be scattered?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
he goes on to describe the various modes of disposal of the dead
in various ages, and among different nations.&nbsp; For instance,
he says that &ldquo;Carnal interment or burying was of the elder
date,&rdquo; as shown by the older examples of Abraham <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>and the
Patriarchs.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the practice of burning was also of
great antiquity, and of no slender extent.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
illustrates this by the Grecian funerals of Homer; the funeral
pyre of Hector; and by early records of the practice in various
countries of Asia, in Rome itself, and in different countries of
both Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>Touching the various modes of disposal of the dead, he says,
&ldquo;The Indian Brachmans thought it the noblest way to end
their days in fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chaldeans abhorred fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Egyptians objected to the merciless consuming of
their bodies by fire, but preserved them, by precious embalments,
depositure in dry earths, or handsome enclosure in glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scythians, who swore by wind and sword, declined
all interment, and made their graves in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Icthyophagi, or fish-eating nations about Egypt,
affected the sea for their grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chinese, without cremation of their bodies, made
use of trees, and much burning, while they plant a pine tree by
their grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jews usually buried their dead, but occasionally
admitted cremation, as when Jabesh burnt the body of Saul, and as
was their practice in times of pestilence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Christians have preferred the practice of the
Patriarchs, returning their bodies, not to ashes, but to
dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then goes on to discuss the various customs in this respect
of the successive inhabitants of England; and he concludes his
learned and interesting treatise by saying, as to the hopes of
Christians, and the comparative unimportance of the mode of
sepulture, <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;To subsist in lasting monuments, to live in
their productions, . . . was large satisfaction unto old
expectations.&nbsp; But all this is nothing in the metaphysicks
of true belief.&nbsp; To live indeed is to be again ourselves,
which being not only a hope, but an evidence in noble believers,
&rsquo;tis all one to lie in St. Innocents&rsquo; Churchyard, or
in the sands of Egypt.&nbsp; Ready to be anything, in the ecstasy
of being ever, and as content with six foot (of earth) as the
<i>Moles</i> of Adrianus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I must hurry on, and next very briefly call your attention
to another of his great works, that which he styled
<i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>, or &ldquo;Enquiries into many
received tenets and presumed truths, which, examined, prove but
vulgar and common errors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These &ldquo;errors,&rdquo; which he treats of in papers or
treatises of various lengths, are very numerous, and for even a
cursory knowledge of them I must refer you to the book
itself.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the subjects, I will only mention a few
of the titles of the errors which he proceeds to
refute:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That crystal is nothing else but ice strongly
congealed,<br />
That an elephant hath no joints,<br />
That a pigeon hath no gall,<br />
Of the Ph&oelig;nix,<br />
Of the Basilisk,<br />
That a Salamander lives in the fire,<br />
That an ostrich digesteth iron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, to take another class of subjects&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That snails have no eyes,<br />
Of the picture of Moses with horns,<br />
That the forbidden fruit was an apple,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>But
though his tracts on these &ldquo;vulgar errors&rdquo; may, in
many instances&mdash;and looked at by the light of our present
knowledge (and we must never forget the immense difference in the
scientific knowledge of the seventeenth and nineteenth
centuries)&mdash;appear not only quaint, but almost trivial, yet
even where the conclusion to the question discussed may appear to
be self-evident, and the reasoning thrown away, we often see an
amount of learning and research displayed which strikes us as
quite remarkable.&nbsp; For example, in discussing the
&ldquo;vulgar error,&rdquo; <i>that the ostrich digesteth
iron</i>, he quotes the following writers in reference to
it:&mdash;Rhodiginus, Johannes Langius, Aristotle, Oppianus,
Pliny, &OElig;lian, Leo Africanus, Fernelius, Riolanus, Albertus
Magnus, and Ulysses Aldrovandus&mdash;a list which may well make
us stand astonished at the extent of his studies, and cause us to
say of him, even in such small matters, &ldquo;<i>Nihil tetigit
quod non ornavit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is almost needless to add
that in this case Sir Thomas arrived at the common-sense
conclusion that although ostriches may swallow iron they do not
digest it.</p>
<p>His greatest works were undoubtedly those which I have already
mentioned.&nbsp; But he wrote also a very noted book, entitled
the <i>Garden of Cyrus</i>, in which he discussed learnedly, and
often fancifully, numerous questions connected with the vegetable
world.&nbsp; He reviewed the practice of Horticulture, and the
arrangements of gardens even from the first garden
mentioned&mdash;that of Eden in Paradise.&nbsp; He makes
reference to the hanging gardens of Babylon; the classical
gardens of the Hesperides and of Alcinous; and to the gardens and
orchards, with their pools of water, of King Solomon.&nbsp; And
he discusses the various forms <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>in which ancient gardens were
presumably laid out&mdash;dwelling largely upon the quincuncial
<a name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a"
class="citation">[135a]</a> arrangements probably adopted.&nbsp;
The whole book teems also with allusions, showing his minute
acquaintance with vegetable phenomena.</p>
<p>As to King Cyrus, he says, &ldquo;All stories do look upon
Cyrus as the splendid and regular planter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne also wrote <i>Some account of the tombs and
monuments in the Cathedral Church of Norwich</i>; and many papers
on the birds, and fishes, and vegetable life of Norfolk and other
parts. <a name="citation135b"></a><a href="#footnote135b"
class="citation">[135b]</a>&nbsp; But I should indeed weary you,
were I merely to enumerate to you the bare titles of the long
list of tracts and papers which his fertile brain produced.</p>
<p>Amongst his <i>Letters</i>, those to his sons, which will be
found in Wilkin&rsquo;s Edition of his works, are worthy of
mention as illustrating the special bent of his mind, his wide
range of thought, the peculiarity of his advice, and the strength
of his family attachments.</p>
<p>The stilted and complimentary, as well as roundabout,
epistolary style of those days is well known.&nbsp; Thus, in
writing to Mr. Evelyn, he begins: &ldquo;Worthy Sir,&mdash;In
obedience unto the commands of my noble friend, Mr. Paston, and
the respects I owe unto so worthy a person as yourself,&rdquo; or
again, addressing Dr. Merritt, he commences: &ldquo;Most honoured
Sir,&mdash;I take the boldness to salute you as a person of
singular worth and learning, and whom I very much respect <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>and
honour,&rdquo; or again, &ldquo;Honoured Sir,&mdash;I am sorry
that I have had diversions of such necessity, as to hinder my
more sudden salute since I received your last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his sons he writes many letters.&nbsp; In these he
addresses his eldest son Edward as &ldquo;Dear Sonne,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Dear Sonne Edward;&rdquo; but those to his younger son
Thomas, always commenced &ldquo;Honest Tom&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Tom&rdquo; only.</p>
<p>Much of his advice to &ldquo;Honest Tom&rdquo; is peculiar
although essentially sound and practical.&nbsp; Thus he advises
him, when a young man in France, in this fashion: &ldquo;I would
be glad you had a good handsome garb of your body, . . . and take
up a commendable boldness, without which you will never be fit
for anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Live soberly and temperately,
the heat of the place (Xaintes) will otherwise mischief you, and
keep within in the heat of the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may
stay your stomach with little pastrys some times in cold
mornings, for I doubt sea larks will be too dear a collation and
drawe too much wine down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, later on, he writes: &ldquo;Bee sober and
complacent.&nbsp; If you quit periwigs it would be better, and
more for your credit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hee that goes to warre
must patiently submit unto the various accidents
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that this &ldquo;Honest Tom&rdquo; was
a worthy son and a fine English sailor we learn from a passage in
another letter to him at a latter period, when a lieutenant of
his Majesty&rsquo;s ship the &ldquo;Marie Rose.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
writes to his son: &ldquo;Mr. Scudamore, your sober and learned
chaplaine, in your voyage with Sir Jeremie Smith, gives you no
small commendations for a sober, studious, courageous, and
diligent person; that he had not met with any of the fleet like
you, so civile, observing, and diligent to <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>your
charge, with the reputation and love of all the shippe; and that
without doubt you would make a famous man and a reputation to
your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can only regret that this promising son did not live to
fulfil the high expectations formed of him.</p>
<p>Finally reference may be made to a <i>Letter</i>, because
stated to have been previously unpublished, which may be found in
the &ldquo;Eastern Counties Collectanea,&rdquo; in which he
exhaustively discusses the nature of <i>a large fish-bone</i> dug
up at Cunnington, and which had been sent to him for his opinion
upon it.</p>
<p>To sum up&mdash;Sir Kenelm Digby writes to Sir T. Browne, of
the <i>Religio Medici</i> as &ldquo;Your excellent piece, . . .
of so weighty subjects, and so strongly penned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson says of him &ldquo;There is no science of which he
does not discover some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge
profane or sacred, obstruse or elegant, which he does not appear
to have cultivated with success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlyle says &ldquo;The conclusion of the essay on urn burial
is absolutely beautiful; a still elegiac mood, so soft, so solemn
and tender, like the song of some departed saint flitting faint
under the everlasting canopy of night&mdash;an echo of deepest
meaning from the great and mighty nations of the dead.&nbsp;
Browne must have been a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn, as I have already quoted, writes of him as &ldquo;That
famous scholar and physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to come nearer home, the late Captain Blakiston, in a
paper read before the Arch&aelig;ological Institute, in Norwich,
in 1847, writes of him as a &ldquo;Great Antiquarian and eminent
citizen; . . . a quaint and original thinker;&rdquo; and as
&ldquo;Leaving behind him a shining reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By general consent Sir Thomas Browne was recognised, <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>not only as
a &ldquo;curious thinker,&rdquo; but as a man of remarkable and
original talent even in his lifetime, and the same reputation
continued after his death.&nbsp; His works have always been
regarded as those of a strong and original thinker, and they have
never been held in higher estimation than at the present
time.&nbsp; And I think I may fairly repeat that the more his
writings are studied the more does their learning and power
impress itself upon our understanding.&nbsp; With many faults,
with many shortcomings&mdash;as judged by the standard of the
present day&mdash;they yet remain the monument of genius, and
worthy to be classed amongst the highest productions of great and
cultivated intellects.</p>
<p>Norwich may be well proud of so great a citizen&mdash;of one
whose memory is held in higher and yet higher esteem, and who is
justly regarded as one of the greatest of her literary men.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only drawback to our satisfaction is the fact that
he was not a native of Norwich.&nbsp; And in this sense we cannot
claim him as our own, as we are proud to claim so many of our
citizens, who have distinguished themselves in literature, in
science, in botany, in departments of natural history, in
medicine, and in painting.&nbsp; But Norwich can look upon him
with pride as an adopted son, as one who elected to live the
whole of his working life in this city; and who identified
himself so absolutely with it, that his name is inseparable from
it, and who will be known for all time as Sir Thomas Browne, of
Norwich.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Addendum</span>.&mdash;On October 19th,
1905, the admirable statue by Mr. Henry Pegram of Sir Thomas
Browne, erected in the Norwich Haymarket, was unveiled by Lord
Avebury, in the presence of the Mayor and other city officials
and of a numerous company.&nbsp; This date was the tercentenary
of the birth of this great philosopher, and he was both born and
died on the 19th October.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
